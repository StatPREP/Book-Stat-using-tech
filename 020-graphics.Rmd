# Graphical Descriptions of Data

In chapter 1, you were introduced to the concepts of population, which
again is a collection of all the measurements from the individuals of
interest. Remember, in most cases you can't collect the entire
population, so you have to take a sample. Thus, you collect data either
through a sample or a census. Now you have a large number of data
values. What can you do with them? No one likes to look at just a set of
numbers. One thing is to organize the data into a table or graph.
Ultimately though, you want to be able to use that graph to interpret
the data, to describe the distribution of the data set, and to explore
different characteristics of the data. The characteristics that will be
discussed in this chapter and the next chapter are:

1.  Center: middle of the data set, also known as the average.

2.  Variation: how much the data varies.

3.  Distribution: shape of the data (symmetric, uniform, or skewed).

4.  Qualitative data: analysis of the data

5.  Outliers: data values that are far from the majority of the data.

6.  Time: changing characteristics of the data over time.

This chapter will focus mostly on using the graphs to understand aspects
of the data, and not as much on how to create the graphs. There is
technology that will create most of the graphs, though it is important
for you to understand the basics of how to create them.

## Qualitative Data

Remember, qualitative data are words describing a characteristic of the
individual. There are several different graphs that are used for
qualitative data. These graphs include bar graphs, Pareto charts, and
pie charts.

Pie charts and bar graphs are the most common ways of displaying
qualitative data. A spreadsheet program like Excel can make both of
them. The first step for either graph is to make a **frequency or
relative frequency table**. A frequency table is a summary of the data
with counts of how often a data value (or category) occurs.

**Example \#2.1.1: Creating a Frequency Table**

> Suppose you have the following data for which type of car students at
> a college drive?
>
> Ford, Chevy, Honda, Toyota, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Nissan, Chevy,
> Toyota, Honda, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes,
> Chevy, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan,
> Honda, Porsche, Hyundai, Chevy, Chevy, Honda, Toyota, Chevy, Ford,
> Nissan, Toyota, Chevy, Honda, Chevy, Saturn, Toyota, Chevy, Chevy,
> Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Toyota, Nissan
>
> A listing of data is too hard to look at and analyze, so you need to
> summarize it. First you need to decide the categories. In this case it

> count how many of each type of cars there are. For example, there are
> 5 Fords, 12 Chevys, and 6 Hondas. This can be put in a frequency
> distribution:

**Table \#2.1.1: Frequency Table for Type of Car Data**

  ---------- -----------
  Category   Frequency
  Ford       5
  Chevy      12
  Honda      6
  Toyota     12
  Nissan     10
  Other      5
  Total      50
  ---------- -----------

> The total of the frequency column should be the number of observations

> Since raw numbers are not as useful to tell other people it is better

>
> This can be written as a decimal, fraction, or percent. You now have a

**Table \#2.1.2: Relative Frequency Table for Type of Car Data**

  ---------- ----------- --------------------
  Category   Frequency   Relative Frequency
  Ford       5           0.10
  Chevy      12          0.24
  Honda      6           0.12
  Toyota     12          0.24
  Nissan     10          0.20
  Other      5           0.10
  Total      50          1.00
  ---------- ----------- --------------------

> The relative frequency column should add up to 1.00. It might be off a little due to rounding errors.

Now that you have the frequency and relative frequency table, it would be good to display this data using a graph. There are several different types of graphs that can be used: bar chart, pie chart, and Pareto charts.

**Bar graphs or charts** consist of the frequencies on one axis and the categories on the other axis. Then you draw rectangles for each category with a height (if frequency is on the vertical axis) or length (if frequency is on the horizontal axis) that is equal to the frequency. All of the rectangles should be the same width, and there should be equally width gaps between each bar.

**Example \#2.1.2: Drawing a Bar Graph**

Draw a bar graph of the data in example \#2.1.1.

**Table \#2.1.2: Frequency Table for Type of Car Data**

  ---------- ----------- --------------------
  Category   Frequency   Relative Frequency
  Ford       5           0.10
  Chevy      12          0.24
  Honda      6           0.12
  Toyota     12          0.24
  Nissan     10          0.20
  Other      5           0.10
  Total      50          1.00
  ---------- ----------- --------------------

> Put the frequency on the vertical axis and the category on the horizontal axis. Then just draw a box above each category whose height is the frequency.

> All graphs are drawn using R. The command in R to create a bar graph is:

> variable\<-c(type in percentages or frequencies for each class with commas in between values)

>barplot(variable,names.arg=c(\"type in name of 1^st^ category\", \"type in name of 2^nd^ category\",...,\"type in name of last category\"), ylim=c(0,number over max), xlab=\"type in label for x-axis\", ylab=\"type in label for y-axis\",ylim=c(0,number above maximum y value), main=\"type in title\", col=\"type in a color\") -- creates a bar graph of the data in a color if you want.

**Some key features of a bar graph:**

-   Equal spacing on each axis.

-   Bars are the same width.

-   There should be labels on each axis and a title for the graph.

-   There should be a scaling on the frequency axis and the categories
    should be listed on the category axis.

-   The bars don't touch.

You can also draw a bar graph using relative frequency on the vertical
axis. This is useful when you want to compare two samples with different
sample sizes. The relative frequency graph and the frequency graph
should look the same, except for the scaling on the frequency axis.

Using R, the command would be:

> car\<-c(0.1, 0.24, 0.12, 0.24, 0.2, 0.1)
>
> barplot(car, names.arg=c(\"Ford\", \"Chevy\", \"Honda\", \"Toyota\",
> \"Nissan\", \"Other\"), xlab=\"Type of Car\", ylab=\"Relative
> Frequency\", main=\"Type of Car Driven by College Students\",
> col=\"blue\", ylim=c(0,.25))

![](media/image3.emf){width="4.652777777777778in"
height="4.652777777777778in"}

Another type of graph for qualitative data is a pie chart. A pie chart
is where you have a circle and you divide pieces of the circle into pie
shapes that are proportional to the size of the relative frequency.
There are 360 degrees in a full circle. Relative frequency is just the
percentage as a decimal. All you have to do to find the angle by
multiplying the relative frequency by 360 degrees. Remember that 180
degrees is half a circle and 90 degrees is a quarter of a circle.

**Example \#2.1.3: Drawing a Pie Chart**

Draw a pie chart of the data in example \#2.1.1.

First you need the relative frequencies.

  Category   Frequency   Relative Frequency
  Ford       5           0.10
  Chevy      12          0.24
  Honda      6           0.12
  Toyota     12          0.24

Pie charts are useful for comparing sizes of categories. Bar charts show
similar information. It really doesn't matter which one you use. It
really is a personal preference and also what information you are trying
to address. However, pie charts are best when you only have a few
categories and the data can be expressed as a percentage. The data
doesn't have to be percentages to draw the pie chart, but if a data
value can fit into multiple categories, you cannot use a pie chart. As
an example, if you asking people about what their favorite national park
is, and you say to pick the top three choices, then the total number of
answers can add up to more than 100% of the people involved. So you
cannot use a pie chart to display the favorite national park.

A third type of qualitative data graph is a **Pareto chart,** which is
just a bar chart with the bars sorted with the highest frequencies on
the left. Here is the Pareto chart for the data in Example \#2.1.1.

**Graph \#2.1.4: Pareto Chart for Type of Car Data**

![](media/image5.emf){width="5.361111111111111in"
height="5.361111111111111in"}

The advantage of Pareto charts is that you can visually see the more
popular answer to the least popular. This is especially useful in
business applications, where you want to know what services your
customers like the most, what processes result in more injuries, which
issues employees find more important, and other type of questions like
these.

There are many other types of graphs that can be used on qualitative
data. There are spreadsheet software packages that will create most of
them, and it is better to look at them to see what can be done. It
depends on your data as to which may be useful. The next example
illustrates one of these types known as a multiple bar graph.

**Example \#2.1.4: Multiple Bar Graph**

> In the Wii Fit game, you can do four different types if exercises:
> yoga, strength, aerobic, and balance. The Wii system keeps track of
> how many minutes you spend on each of the exercises everyday. The
> following graph is the data for Dylan over one week time period.
> Discuss any indication you can infer from the graph.

**Graph \#2.1.5: Multiple Bar Chart for Wii Fit Data**

> ![](media/image6.png){width="4.972222222222222in"
> height="3.0555555555555554in"}
>
> **Solution:**
>
> It appears that Dylan spends more time on balance exercises than on
> any other exercises on any given day. He seems to spend less time on
> strength exercises on a given day. There are several days when the
> amount of exercise in the different categories is almost equal.

The usefulness of a multiple bar graph is the ability to compare several
different categories over another variable, in example \#2.1.4 the
variable would be time. This allows a person to interpret the data with
a little more ease.

## Quantitative Data

The graph for quantitative data looks similar to a bar graph, except there are some major differences. First, in a bar graph the categories can be put in any order on the horizontal axis. There is no set order for these data values. You can't say how the data is distributed based on the shape, since the shape can change just by putting the categories in different orders. With quantitative data, the data are in specific orders, since you are dealing with numbers. With quantitative data, you can talk about a distribution, since the shape only changes a little bit depending on how many categories you set up. This is called a **frequency distribution**.

This leads to the second difference from bar graphs. In a bar graph, the categories that you made in the frequency table were determined by you. In quantitative data, the categories are numerical categories, and the numbers are determined by how many categories (or what are called classes) you choose. If two people have the same number of categories, then they will have the same frequency distribution. Whereas in qualitative data, there can be many different categories depending on the point of view of the author. 

The third difference is that the categories touch with quantitative data, and there will be no gaps in the graph. The reason that bar graphs have gaps is to show that the categories do not continue on, like they do in quantitative data. Since the graph for quantitative data is different from qualitative data, it is given a new name. The name of the graph is a **histogram**. To create a histogram, you must first create the frequency distribution. The idea of a frequency distribution is to take the interval that the data spans and divide it up into equal subintervals called classes.

**Summary of the steps involved in making a frequency distribution:**

1.  Find the range = largest value -- smallest value

2.  Pick the number of classes to use. Usually the number of classes is     between five and twenty. Five classes are used if there are a small     number of data points and twenty classes if there are a large number     of data points (over 1000 data points). (Note: categories will now     be called classes from now on.)

3.  . Always round up to the next integer (even if the answer is already     a whole number go to the next integer). If you don't do this, your     last class will not contain your largest data value, and you would     have to add another class just for it. If you round up, then your     largest data value will fall in the last class, and there are no     issues.

4.  Create the classes. Each class has limits that determine which     values fall in each class. To find the class limits, set the     smallest value as the lower class limit for the first class. Then     add the class width to the lower class limit to get the next lower     class limit. Repeat until you get all the classes. The upper class     limit for a class is one less than the lower limit for the next     class.

5.  In order for the classes to actually touch, then one class needs to     start where the previous one ends. This is known as the class     boundary. To find the class boundaries, subtract 0.5 from the lower     class limit and add 0.5 to the upper class limit.

6.  Sometimes it is useful to find the class midpoint. The process is

7.  To figure out the number of data points that fall in each class, go     through each data value and see which class boundaries it is     between. Utilizing tally marks may be helpful in counting the data     values. The frequency for a class is the number of data values that     fall in the class.

Note: the above description is for data values that are whole numbers. If you data value has decimal places, then your class width should be rounded up to the nearest value with the same number of decimal places as the original data. In addition, your class boundaries should have one more decimal place than the original data. As an example, if your data have one decimal place, then the class width would have one decimal place, and the class boundaries are formed by adding and subtracting 0.05 from each class limit.

R command for a frequency distribution:

**To create a frequency distribution:**

summary(variable) -- so you can find out the minimum and maximum.

breaks = seq(min, number above max, by = class width)

breaks -- so you can see the breaks that R made.

variable.cut=cut(variable, breaks, right=FALSE) -- this will cut up the
data into the classes.

variable.freq=table(variable.cut) -- this will create the frequency
table.

variable.freq -- this will display the frequency table.

For the data in Example \#2.2.1, the R command would be:

> rent\<-c(1500, 1350, 350, 1200, 850, 900, 1500, 1150, 1500, 900, 1400,

It is difficult to determine the basic shape of the distribution by
looking at the frequency distribution. It would be easier to look at a
graph. The graph of a frequency distribution for quantitative data is
called a **frequency** **histogram** or just histogram for short.

**Histogram**: a graph of the frequencies on the vertical axis and the
class boundaries on the horizontal axis. Rectangles where the height is
the frequency and the width is the class width are draw for each class.

**Example \#2.2.2: Drawing a Histogram **

Draw a histogram for the distribution from example \#2.2.1.

Frequencies are helpful, but understanding the relative size each class
is to the total is also useful. To find this you can divide the
frequency by the total to create a relative frequency. If you have the
relative frequencies for all of the classes, then you have a relative
frequency distribution.

**Relative Frequency Distribution **

A variation on a frequency distribution is a relative frequency
distribution. Instead of giving the frequencies for each class, the
relative frequencies are calculated.

This gives you percentages of data that fall in each class.

The graph of the relative frequency is known as a relative frequency
histogram. It looks identical to the frequency histogram, but the
vertical axis is relative frequency instead of just frequencies.

Another useful piece of information is how many data points fall below a
particular class boundary. As an example, a teacher may want to know how
many students received below an 80%, a doctor may want to know how many
adults have cholesterol below 160, or a manager may want to know how
many stores gross less than \$2000 per day. This is known as a
**cumulative frequency**. If you want to know what percent of the data
falls below a certain class boundary, then this would be a **cumulative
relative frequency**. For cumulative frequencies you are finding how
many data values fall below the upper class limit.

To create a **cumulative frequency distribution**, count the number of
data points that are below the upper class boundary, starting with the
first class and working up to the top class. The last upper class
boundary should have all of the data points below it. Also include the
number of data points below the lowest class boundary, which is zero.

**Example \#2.2.5: Creating a Cumulative Frequency Distribution**

\#2.2.1.

Again, it is hard to look at the data the way it is. A graph would be
useful. The graph for cumulative frequency is called an **ogive**
(o-jive). To create an ogive, first create a scale on both the
horizontal and vertical axes that will fit the data. Then plot the
points of the class upper class boundary versus the cumulative
frequency. Make sure you include the point with the lowest class
boundary and the 0 cumulative frequency. Then just connect the dots.

**Example \#2.2.6: Drawing an Ogive**

Draw an ogive for the data in example \#2.2.1.

> **Solution:**
>
> In R, the commands would be:
>
> plot(breaks,cumfreq0, main=\"title you want to use\", xlab=\"label you
> want to use\", ylab=\"label you want to use\", ylim=c(0, number above
> maximum cumulative frequency) -- plots the ogive
>
> lines(breaks,cumfreq0) -- connects the dots on the ogive
>
> For this example, the commands would be:
>
> Plot(breaks,cumfreq0, main="Cumulative Frequency for Monthly Rent",
> xlab="Monthly Rent (\$)", ylab="Cumulative Frequency", ylim=c(0,25))

> ![](media/image26.emf){width="4.666666666666667in"
> height="4.666666666666667in"}

The usefulness of a ogive is to allow the reader to find out how many
students pay less than a certain value, and also what amount of monthly
rent is paid by a certain number of students. As an example, suppose you
want to know how many students pay less than \$1500 a month in rent,
then you can go up from the \$1500 until you hit the graph and then you
go over to the cumulative frequency axes to see what value corresponds
to this value. It appears that around 20 students pay less than \$1500.
(See graph \#2.2.4.)

**\
**

> **Graph \#2.2.4: Ogive for Monthly Rent with Example**

![](media/image27.emf){width="3.625in" height="3.625in"}

Also, if you want to know the amount that 15 students pay less than,
then you start at 15 on the vertical axis and then go over to the graph
and down to the horizontal axis where the line intersects the graph. You
can see that 15 students pay less than about \$1200 a month. (See graph
\#2.2.5.)

**Graph \#2.2.5: Ogive for Monthly Rent with Example**

![](media/image28.emf){width="3.6527777777777777in"
height="3.6527777777777777in"}

If you graph the cumulative relative frequency then you can find out
what percentage is below a certain number instead of just the number of
people below a certain value.

Shapes of the distribution:

When you look at a distribution, look at the basic shape. There are some
basic shapes that are seen in histograms. Realize though that some
distributions have no shape. The common shapes are symmetric, skewed,
and uniform. Another interest is how many peaks a graph may have. This
is known as modal.

Symmetric means that you can fold the graph in half down the middle and
the two sides will line up. You can think of the two sides as being
mirror images of each other. Skewed means one "tail" of the graph is
longer than the other. The graph is skewed in the direction of the
longer tail (backwards from what you would expect). A uniform graph has
all the bars the same height.

Modal refers to the number of peaks. Unimodal has one peak and bimodal
has two peaks. Usually if a graph has more than two peaks, the modal
information is not longer of interest.

Other important features to consider are gaps between bars, a repetitive
pattern, how spread out is the data, and where the center of the graph
is.

**Examples of graphs:**

This graph is roughly symmetric and unimodal:

**Graph \#2.2.6: Symmetric, Unimodal Graph**

> ![](media/image29.png){width="5.013888888888889in"

This graph is symmetric and bimodal:

![](media/image30.png){width="5.041666666666667in"
height="3.4305555555555554in"}

This graph is skewed to the right:

There are occasions where the class limits in the frequency distribution
are predetermined. Example \#2.2.8 demonstrates this situation.

**Example \#2.2.8: Creating a Frequency Distribution and Histogram**

> The following are the percentage grades of 25 students from a
> statistics course. Make a frequency distribution and histogram.
>
> **Table \#2.2.7: Data of Test Grades**

  62   87   81   69   87   62   45   95   76   76

  62   71   65   67   72   80   40   77   87   58
  84   73   93   64   89                       

**Solution:**

> Since this data is percent grades, it makes more sense to make the
> classes in multiples of 10, since grades are usually 90 to 100%, 80 to
> 90%, and so forth. It is easier to not use the class boundaries, but
> instead use the class limits and think of the upper class limit being
> up to but not including the next classes lower limit. As an example
> the class 80 -- 90 means a grade of 80% up to but not including a 90%.
> A student with an 89.9% would be in the 80-90 class.

## Other Graphical Representations of Data

There are many other types of graphs. Some of the more common ones are the frequency polygon, the dot plot, the stem plot, scatter plot, and a time-series plot. There are also many different graphs that have emerged lately for qualitative data. Many are found in publications and websites. The following is a description of the stem plot, the scatter plot, and the time-series plot.

**Stem Plots**

Stem plots are a quick and easy way to look at small samples of numerical data. You can look for any patterns or any strange data values. It is easy to compare two samples using stem plots.

The first step is to divide each number into 2 parts, the stem (such as the leftmost digit) and the leaf (such as the rightmost digit). There are no set rules, you just have to look at the data and see what makes sense.

**Example \#2.3.1: Stem Plot for Grade Distribution**

> The following are the percentage grades of 25 students from a
> statistics course. Draw a stem plot of the data.
>
> **Table \#2.3.1: Data of Test Grades**

  62   87   81   69   87   62   45   95   76   76
  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
  62   71   65   67   72   80   40   77   87   58
  84   73   93   64   89                       

> **Solution:**
>
> Divide each number so that the tens digit is the stem and the ones
> digit is the leaf. 62 becomes 6\|2.
>
> Make a vertical chart with the stems on the left of a vertical bar. Be
> sure to fill in any missing stems. In other words, the stems should
> have equal spacing (for example, count by ones or count by tens). The
> graph \#2.3.1 shows the stems for this example.

You can create a stem and leaf plot on R. the command is:

stem(variable) -- creates a stem and leaf plot, if you do not get a stem
plot that shows all of the stems then use scale = a number. Adjust the
number until you see all of the stems. So you would have stem(variable,
scale = a number)

For Example \#2.3.1, the command would be

> grades\<-c(62, 87, 81, 69, 87, 62, 45, 95, 76, 76, 62, 71, 65, 67, 72,
> 80, 40, 77, 87, 58, 84, 73, 93, 64, 89)
>
> stem(grades, scale = 2)

> Now just put a title on the stem plot

**Scatter Plot**

Sometimes you have two different variables and you want to see if they
are related in any way. A scatter plot helps you to see what the
relationship would look like. A scatter plot is just a plotting of the
ordered pairs.

**Example \#2.3.2: Scatter Plot**

> Is there any relationship between elevation and high temperature on a
> given day? The following data are the high temperatures at various
> cities on a single day and the elevation of the city.
>
> **Table \#2.3.2: Data of Temperature versus Elevation**

**Time-Series **

A time-series plot is a graph showing the data measurements in
chronological order, the data being quantitative data. For example, a
time-series plot is used to show profits over the last 5 years. To
create a time-series plot, the time always goes on the horizontal axis,
and the other variable goes on the vertical axis. Then plot the ordered
pairs and connect the dots. The purpose of a time-series graph is to
look for trends over time. Caution, you must realize that the trend may
not continue. Just because you see an increase, doesn't mean the
increase will continue forever. As an example, prior to 2007, many
people noticed that housing prices were increasing. The belief at the
time was that housing prices would continue to increase. However, the
housing bubble burst in 2007, and many houses lost value, and haven't
recovered.

**Example \#2.3.3: Time-Series Plot**

> The following table tracks the weight of a dieter, where the time in
> months is measuring how long since the person started the diet.
>
> **Table \#2.3.3: Data of Weights versus Time**

  ----------------- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
  Time (months)     0     1     2     3     4     5
  Weight (pounds)   200   195   192   193   190   187

Be careful when making a graph. If you don't start the vertical axis at
0, then the change can look much more dramatic than it really is. As an
example, graph \#2.3.8 shows the graph \#2.3.7 with a different scaling
on the vertical axis. Notice the decrease in weight looks much larger
than it really is.
