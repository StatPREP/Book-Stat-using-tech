# Numerical Descriptions of Data

Chapter 1 discussed what a population, sample, parameter, and statistic are, and how to take different types of samples. Chapter 2 discussed ways to graphically display data. There was also a discussion of important characteristics: center, variations, distribution, outliers, and changing characteristics of the data over time. Distributions and outliers can be answered using graphical means. Finding the center and variation can be done using numerical methods that will be discussed in this chapter. Both graphical and numerical methods are part of a branch of statistics known as **descriptive statistics**. Later descriptive statistics will be used to make decisions and/or estimate population parameters using methods that are part of the branch called **inferential statistics**.

## Measures of Center

This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what to expect on average. Such as when you pick a major, you would probably ask how much you expect to earn in that field. If you are thinking of relocating to a new town, you might ask how much you can expect to pay for housing. If you are planting vegetables in the spring, you might want to know how long it will be until you can harvest. These questions, and many more, can be answered by knowing the center of the data set. There are three measures of the "center" of the data. They are the mode, median, and mean. Any of the values can be referred to as the "average."

The **mode** is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs most often.

The **median** is the data value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set.

The **mean** is the arithmetic average of the numbers. This is the center that most people call the average, though all three -- mean, median, and mode -- really are averages.

There are no symbols for the mode and the median, but the mean is used a great deal, and statisticians gave it a symbol. There are actually two symbols, one for the population parameter and one for the sample statistic. In most cases you cannot find the population parameter, so you use the sample statistic to estimate the population parameter.

**Population Mean:**

, pronounced mu

*N* is the size of the population.

*x* represents a data value.

means to add up all of the data values.

**Sample Mean**:

, pronounced x bar.

*n* is the size of the sample.

*x* represents a data value.

means to add up all of the data values.

The value for is used to estimate since can't be calculated in most
situations.

A data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two
values for the most number of times then both values are the mode and
the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point occurs the
same number of times, there is no mode. If there are more than two
numbers that appear the most times, then usually there is no mode.

In example \#3.1.1, there were an odd number of data points. In that
case, the median was just the middle number. What happens if there is an
even number of data points? What would you do?

You can do the calculations for the mean and median using the
technology.

The procedure for calculating the sample mean () and the sample median
(Med) on the TI-83/84 is in figures 3.1.1 through 3.1.4. First you need
to go into the STAT menu, and then Edit. This will allow you to type in
your data (see figure \#3.1.1).

> **Figure \#3.1.1: TI-83/84 Calculator Edit Setup**
>
> ![](media/image11.png){width="2.9444444444444446in"
> height="2.2129057305336834in"}

Once you have the data into the calculator, you then go back to the STAT
menu, move over to CALC, and then choose 1-Var Stats (see figure
\#3.1.2). The calculator will now put 1-Var Stats on the main screen.
Now type in L1 (2nd button and 1) and then press ENTER. (Note if you
have the newer operating system on the TI-84, then the procedure is
slightly different.) If you press the down arrow, you will see the rest
of the output from the calculator. The results from the calculator are
in figure \#3.1.3.

The commands for finding the mean and median using R are as follows:

> variable\<-c(type in your data with commas in between)
>
> To find the mean, use mean(variable)
>
> To find the median, use median(variable)

So for this example, the commands would be

Variable: *x* = weight of a cat

> The data is already in order, thus the median is between 8.2 and 8.2.

> The mean is much higher than the median. Why is this? Notice that when

An outlier is a data value that is very different from the rest of the
data. It can be really high or really low. Extreme values may be an
outlier if the extreme value is far enough from the center. In example
\#3.1.4, the data value 22.1 pounds is an extreme value and it may be an
outlier.

If there are extreme values in the data, the median is a better measure
of the center than the mean. If there are no extreme values, the mean
and the median will be similar so most people use the mean.

The mean is not a resistant measure because it is affected by extreme
values. The median and the mode are resistant measures because they are
not affected by extreme values.

As a consumer you need to be aware that people choose the measure of
center that best supports their claim. When you read an article in the
newspaper and it talks about the "average" it usually means the mean but
sometimes it refers to the median. Some articles will use the word
"median" instead of "average" to be more specific. If you need to make
an important decision and the information says "average", it would be
wise to ask if the "average" is the mean or the median before you
decide.

As an example, suppose that a company wants to use the mean salary as
the average salary for the company. This is because the high salaries of
the administration will pull the mean higher. The company can say that
the employees are paid well because the average is high. However, the
employees want to use the median since it discounts the extreme values
of the administration and will give a lower value of the average. This
will make the salaries seem lower and that a raise is in order.

Why use the mean instead of the median? The reason is because when
multiple samples are taken from the same population, the sample means
tend to be more consistent than other measures of the center. The sample
mean is the more reliable measure of center.

To understand how the different measures of center related to skewed or
symmetric distributions, see figure \#3.1.5. As you can see sometimes
the mean is smaller than the median and mode, sometimes the mean is
larger than the median and mode, and sometimes they are the same values.

**Figure \#3.1.5: Mean, Median, Mode as Related to a Distribution**

![](media/image18.jpg){width="5.986666666666666in"
height="2.1533333333333333in"}

One last type of average is a weighted average. Weighted averages are
used quite often in real life. Some teachers use them in calculating
your grade in the course, or your grade on a project. Some employers use
them in employee evaluations. The idea is that some activities are more
important than others. As an example, a fulltime teacher at a community
college may be evaluated on their service to the college, their service
to the community, whether their paperwork is turned in on time, and
their teaching. However, teaching is much more important than whether
their paperwork is turned in on time. When the evaluation is completed,
more weight needs to be given to the teaching and less to the paperwork.
This is a weighted average.

## Measures of Spread

Variability is an important idea in statistics. If you were to measure the height of everyone in your classroom, every observation gives you a different value. That means not every student has the same height. Thus there is variability in people's heights. If you were to take a sample of the income level of people in a town, every sample gives you different information. There is variability between samples too. Variability describes how the data are spread out. If the data are very close to each other, then there is low variability. If the data are very spread out, then there is high variability. How do you measure variability? It would be good to have a number that measures it. This section will describe some of the different measures of variability, also known as variation.

In example \#3.1.1, the average weight of a cat was calculated to be 8.02 pounds. How much does this tell you about the weight of all cats? Can you tell if most of the weights were close to 8.02 or were the weights really spread out? What are the highest weight and the lowest weight? All you know is that the center of the weights is 8.02 pounds.

You need more information.

The **range** of a set of data is the difference between the highest and the lowest data values (or maximum and minimum values).

**Example \#3.2.1: Finding the Range**

The range doesn't really provide a very accurate picture of the
variability. A better way to describe how the data is spread out is
needed. Instead of looking at the distance the highest value is from the
lowest how about looking at the distance each value is from the mean.
This distance is called the **deviation**.

The standard deviation is the average (mean) distance from a data point
to the mean. It can be thought of as how much a typical data point
differs from the mean.

The **sample variance** formula:

where is the sample mean, *n* is the sample size, and means to find the
sum

The **sample standard deviation** formula:

The on the bottom has to do with a concept called degrees of freedom.
Basically, it makes the sample standard deviation a better approximation
of the population standard deviation.

The **population variance** formula:

where is the Greek letter sigma and represents the population variance,
is the population mean, and N is the size of the population.

The **population standard deviation** formula:

Note: the sum of the deviations should always be 0. If it isn't, then it
is because you rounded, you used the median instead of the mean, or you
made an error. Try not to round too much in the calculations for
standard deviation since each rounding causes a slight error.

You can do the calculations for the descriptive statistics using the
technology. The procedure for calculating the sample mean () and the
sample standard deviation () for in example \#3.2.3 on the TI-83/84 is
in figures 3.2.1 through 3.2.4 (the procedure is the same for ). Note
the calculator gives you the population standard deviation () because it
doesn't know whether the data you input is a population or a sample. You
need to decide which value you need to use, based on whether you have a
population or sample. In almost all cases you have a sample and will be
using . Also, the calculator uses the notation of instead of just *s*.
It is just a way for it to denote the information. First you need to go
into the STAT menu, and then Edit. This will allow you to type in your
data (see figure \#3.2.1).

> ![](media/image90.gif){width="2.75in" height="1.8611111111111112in"}

Once you have the data into the calculator, you then go back to the STAT
menu, move over to CALC, and then choose 1-Var Stats (see figure
\#3.2.2). The calculator will now put 1-Var Stats on the main screen.
Now type in L2 (2nd button and 2) and then press ENTER. (Note if you
have the newer operating system on the TI-84, then the procedure is
slightly different.) The results from the calculator are in figure
\#3.2.4.

The processes for finding the mean, median, range, standard deviation,
and variance on R are as follows:

> variable\<-c(type in your data)
>
> To find the mean, use mean(variable)
>
> To find the median, use median(variable)
>
> To find the range, use range(variable). Then find maximum -- minimum.
>
> To find the standard deviation, use sd(variable)
>
> To find the variance, use var(variable)

For the second data set in example \#3.2.3, the commands and results
would be

> productivity\_2\<-c(60, 58, 66, 59, 58)
>
> mean(productivity\_2)
>
> \[1\] 60.2
>
> median(productivity\_2)
>
> \[1\] 59
>
> range(productivity\_2)
>
> \[1\] 58 66
>
> sd(productivity\_2)
>
> \[1\] 3.34664
>
> var(productivity\_2)
>
> \[1\] 11.2

In general a "small" standard deviation means the data is close together
(more consistent) and a "large" standard deviation means the data is
spread out (less consistent). Sometimes you want consistent data and
sometimes you don't. As an example if you are making bolts, you want to
lengths to be very consistent so you want a small standard deviation. If
you are administering a test to see who can be a pilot, you want a large
standard deviation so you can tell who are the good pilots and who are
the bad ones.

What do "small" and "large" mean? To a bicyclist whose average speed is
20 mph, *s* = 20 mph is huge. To an airplane whose average speed is 500
mph, *s* = 20 mph is nothing. The "size" of the variation depends on the
size of the numbers in the problem and the mean. Another situation where
you can determine whether a standard deviation is small or large is when
you are comparing two different samples such as in example \#3.2.3. A
sample with a smaller standard deviation is more consistent than a
sample with a larger standard deviation.

Many other books and authors stress that there is a computational
formula for calculating the standard deviation. However, this formula
doesn't give you an idea of what standard deviation is and what you are
doing. It is only good for doing the calculations quickly. It goes back
to the days when standard deviations were calculated by hand, and the
person needed a quick way to calculate the standard deviation. It is an
archaic formula that this author is trying to eradicate it. It is not
necessary anymore, since most calculators and computers will do the
calculations for you with as much meaning as this formula gives. It is
suggested that you never use it. If you want to understand what the
standard deviation is doing, then you should use the definition formula.
If you want an answer quickly, use a computer or calculator.

**Use of Standard Deviation**

One of the uses of the standard deviation is to describe how a
population is distributed by using Chebyshev's Theorem. This theorem
works for any distribution, whether it is skewed, symmetric, bimodal, or
any other shape. It gives you an idea of how much data is a certain
distance on either side of the mean.

Chebyshev's Theorem

For [any]{.underline} set of data:

At least 75% of the data fall in the interval from.

At least 88.9% of the data fall in the interval from.

At least 93.8% of the data fall in the interval from.

Chebyshev's Theorem says that at least 75% of the data is within two
standard deviations of the mean. That percentage is fairly high. There
isn't much data outside two standard deviations. A rule that can be
followed is that if a data value is within two standard deviations, then
that value is a common data value. If the data value is outside two
standard deviations of the mean, either above or below, then the number
is uncommon. It could even be called unusual. An easy calculation that
you can do to figure it out is to find the difference between the data
point and the mean, and then divide that answer by the standard
deviation. As a formula this would be

.

If you don't know the population mean, , and the population standard
deviation, , then use the sample mean, , and the sample standard
deviation, *s*, to estimate the population parameter values. However,
realize that using the sample standard deviation may not actually be
very accurate.

## Ranking

Along with the center and the variability, another useful numerical
measure is the ranking of a number. A **percentile** is a measure of
ranking. It represents a location measurement of a data value to the
rest of the values. Many standardized tests give the results as a
percentile. Doctors also use percentiles to track a child's growth.

The ***k*th percentile** is the data value that has k% of the data at or
below that value.

**Example \#3.3.1: Interpreting Percentile**

a.  What does a score of the 90^th^ percentile mean?

> **Solution:**
>
> This means that 90% of the scores were at or below this score. (A
> person did the same as or better than 90% of the test takers.)

b.  What does a score of the 70^th^ percentile mean?

> **Solution:**
>
> This means that 70% of the scores were at or below this score.

**Example \#3.3.2: Percentile Versus Score**

> If the test was out of 100 points and you scored at the 80^th^
> percentile, what was your score on the test?
>
> **Solution:**
>
> You don't know! All you know is that you scored the same as or better
> than 80% of the people who took the test. If all the scores were
> really low, you could have still failed the test. On the other hand,
> if many of the scores were high you could have gotten a 95% or so.

There are special percentiles called quartiles. Quartiles are numbers
that divide the data into fourths. One fourth (or a quarter) of the data
falls between consecutive quartiles.

**To find the quartiles:**

1\) Sort the data in increasing order.

2\) Find the median, this divides the data list into 2 halves.

3\) Find the median of the data below the median. This value is *Q1*.

4\) Find the median of the data above the median. This value is *Q3*.

Ignore the median in both calculations for *Q1* and *Q3*

If you record the quartiles together with the maximum and minimum you
have five numbers. This is known as the five-number summary. The
five-number summary consists of the minimum, the first quartile (*Q1*),
the median, the third quartile (*Q3*), and the maximum (in that order).

The interquartile range, *IQR*, is the difference between the first and
third quartiles, *Q1* and *Q3*. Half of the data (50%) falls in the
interquartile range. If the *IQR* is "large" the data is spread out and
if the *IQR* is "small" the data is closer together.

Interquartile Range (*IQR*)

**Determining probable outliers from IQR: *fences***

A value that is less than (this value is often referred to as a
***low*** ***fence***) is considered an outlier.

Similarly, a value that is more than (the ***high*** ***fence***) is
considered an outlier.

A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical display of the
five-number summary. It can be drawn vertically or horizontally. The
basic format is a box from *Q1* to *Q3*, a vertical line across the box
for the median and horizontal lines as whiskers extending out each end
to the minimum and maximum. The minimum and maximum can be represented
with dots. Don't forget to label the tick marks on the number line and
give the graph a title.

An alternate form of a Box-and-Whiskers Plot, known as a modified box
plot, only extends the left line to the smallest value greater than the
*low fence*, and extends the left line to the largest value less than
the *high fence*, and displays markers (dots, circles or asterisks) for
each outlier.

 

If the data are *symmetrical*, then the box plot will be visibly
symmetrical. If the data distribution has a left skew or a right skew,
the line on that side of the box plot will be visibly long.  If the plot
is symmetrical, and the four quartiles are all about the same length,
then the data are likely a near *uniform* distribution. If a box plot is
symmetrical, and both outside lines are noticeably longer than the Q1 to
median and median to Q3 distance, the distribution is then probably
*bell-shaped.*

To find the interquartile range (*IQR*)

The middle 50% of life expectancies are within 9 years.

You can draw 2 box plots side by side (or one above the other) to
compare 2 samples. Since you want to compare the two data sets, make
sure the box plots are on the same axes. As an example, suppose you look
at the box-and-whiskers plot for life expectancy for European countries
and Southeast Asian countries.

> **Graph \#3.3.3: Box Plot of Life Expectancy of Two Regions**

![](media/image128.emf){width="6.0in" height="2.4803149606299213in"}

Looking at the box-and-whiskers plot, you will notice that the three
quartiles for life expectancy are all higher for the European countries,
yet the minimum life expectancy for the European countries is less than
that for the Southeast Asian countries. The life expectancy for the
European countries appears to be skewed left, while the life
expectancies for the Southeast Asian countries appear to be more
symmetric. There are of course more qualities that can be compared
between the two graphs.

To find the five-number summary using R, the command is:

> variable\<-c(type in data with commas)\
> summary(variable)

This command will give you the five number summary and the mean.

For example \#3.3.4, the commands would be

> expectancy\<-c(70, 67, 69, 65, 69, 77, 65, 68, 75, 74, 64)
>
> summary(expectancy)
>
> The output would be:
>
> Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.
>
> 64.00 66.00 69.00 69.36 72.00 77.00

To draw the box plot the command is boxplot(variable, main=\"title you
want\", xlab=\"label you want\", horizontal = TRUE). The horizontal =
TRUE orients the box plot to be horizontal. If you leave that part off,
the box plot will be vertical by default. 

For example \#3.3.4, the command is 

boxplot(expectancy, main=\"Life Expectancy of Southeast Asian Countries
in 2011\",horizontal=TRUE, xlab=\"Life Expectancy\")

You should get the box plot in graph \#3.3.4.

**Graph \#3.3.4: Box plot for Life Expectance in Southeast Asian
Countries**

![](media/image129.emf){width="3.125in" height="3.125in"}

This is known as a modified box plot. Instead of plotting the maximum
and minimum, the box plot has as a lower line , and as an upper line, .
Any values below the lower line or above the upper line are considered
outliers. Outliers are plotted as dots on the modified box plot. This
data set does not have any outliers.

**Example \#3.3.5: Putting it all together**

A random sample was collected on the health expenditures (as a % of GDP)
of countries around the world. The data is in Table \#3.3.11. Using
graphical and numerical descriptive statistics, analyze the data and use
it to predict the health expenditures of all countries in the world.

**Table \#3.3.11: Health Expenditures as a Percentage of GDP**

  3.35   5.94   10.64   5.24   3.79   5.65   7.66    7.38    5.87   11.15
  ------ ------ ------- ------ ------ ------ ------- ------- ------ -------
  5.96   4.78   7.75    2.72   9.50   7.69   10.05   11.96   8.18   6.74
  5.89   6.20   5.98    8.83   6.78   6.66   9.45    5.41    5.16   8.55

**Solution:**

> create a histogram.
