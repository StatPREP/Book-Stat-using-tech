# Probability

[NOTE IN DRAFT: Often you'll want to have an introductory paragraph before breaking into sub-sections]

## Empirical Probability

One story about how probability theory was developed is that a gambler wanted to know when to bet more and when to bet less. He talked to a couple of friends of his that happened to be mathematicians. Their names were Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Since then many other mathematicians have worked to develop probability theory.

Understanding probabilities are important in life. Examples of mundane questions that probability can answer for you are if you need to carry an umbrella or wear a heavy coat on a given day. More important questions that probability can help with are your chances that the car you are buying will need more maintenance, your chances of passing a class, your chances of winning the lottery, your chances of being in a car accident, and the chances that the U.S. will be attacked by terrorists. Most people do not have a very good understanding of probability, so they worry about being attacked by a terrorist but not about being in a car accident. The probability of being in a terrorist attack is much smaller than the probability of being in a car accident, thus it actually would make more sense to worry about driving. Also, the chance of you winning the lottery is very small, yet many people will spend the money on lottery tickets. Yet, if instead they saved the money that they spend on the lottery, they would have more money. In general, events that have a low probability (under 5%) are unlikely to occur. Whereas if an event has a high probability of happening (over 80%), then there is a good chance that the event will happen. This chapter will present some of the theory that you need to help make a determination of whether an event is likely to happen or not.

First you need some definitions.

**Experiment:** an activity that has specific results that can occur, but it is unknown which results will occur.

**Outcomes:** the results of an experiment

**Event:** a set of certain outcomes of an experiment that you want to have happen

**Sample Space:** collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Usually denoted as SS.

**Event space:** the set of outcomes that make up an event. The symbol is usually a capital letter.

Start with an experiment. Suppose that the experiment is rolling a die. The sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The event that you want is to get a 6, and the event space is {6}. To do this, roll a die 10 times. When you do that, you get a 6 two times. Based on this experiment, the probability of getting a 6 is 2 out of 10 or 1/5. To get more accuracy, repeat the experiment more times. It is easiest to put this in a table, where *n* represents the number of times the experiment is repeated. When you put the number of 6s found over the number of times you repeat the experiment, this is the relative frequency. 


**Table \#4.1.1: Trials for Die Experiment**

  *n*Number of 6s   Relative Frequency
  ------ -------------- --------------------
  10 2  0.2
  50 6  0.12
  10018 0.18
  50081 0.162
  1000   1630.163

Notice that as *n* increased, the relative frequency seems to approach a
number. It looks like it is approaching 0.163. You can say that the
probability of getting a 6 is approximately 0.163. If you want more
accuracy, then increase *n* even more.

These probabilities are called **experimental probabilities** since they
are found by actually doing the experiment. They come about from the
relative frequencies and give an approximation of the true probability.
The approximate probability of an event *A*, *,* is

**Experimental Probabilities**

For the event of getting a 6, the probability would be .

You must do experimental probabilities whenever it is not possible to
calculate probabilities using other means. An example is if you want to
find the probability that a family has 5 children, you would have to
actually look at many families, and count how many have 5 children. Then
you could calculate the probability. Another example is if you want to
figure out if a die is fair. You would have to roll the die many times
and count how often each side comes up. Make sure you repeat an
experiment many times, because otherwise you will not be able to
estimate the true probability. This is due to the law of large numbers.

**Law of large numbers**: as *n* increases, the relative frequency tends
towards the actual probability value.

Note: probability, relative frequency, percentage, and proportion are all different words for the same concept. Also, probabilities can be given as percentages, decimals, or fractions.

## Theoretical Probability

It is not always feasible to conduct an experiment over and over again, so it would be better to be able to find the probabilities without conducting the experiment. These probabilities are called **Theoretical Probabilities.**

To be able to do theoretical probabilities, there is an assumption that you need to consider. It is that all of the outcomes in the sample space need to be **equally likely outcomes**. This means that every outcome of the experiment needs to have the same chance of happening.

**Example \#4.2.1: Equally Likely Outcomes**

> Which of the following experiments have equally likely outcomes?

a.  Rolling a fair die.

**Solution:**

> Since the die is fair, every side of the die has the same chance of
> coming up. The outcomes are the different sides, so each outcome is
> equally likely

b.  Flip a coin that is weighted so one side comes up more often than
the other.

**Solution:**

Since the coin is weighted, one side is more likely to come up than
the other side. The outcomes are the different sides, so each
outcome is not equally likely

c.  Pull a ball out of a can containing 6 red balls and 8 green balls.
All balls are the same size.

**Solution:**

Since each ball is the same size, then each ball has the same chance
of being chosen. The outcomes of this experiment are the individual
balls, so each outcome is equally likely. Don't assume that because
the chances of pulling a red ball are less than pulling a green ball
that the outcomes are not equally likely. The outcomes are the
individual balls and they are equally likely.

d.  Picking a card from a deck.

**Solution:**

If you assume that the deck is fair, then each card has the same
chance of being chosen. Thus the outcomes are equally likely
outcomes. You do have to make this assumption. For many of the
experiments you will do, you do have to make this kind of
assumption.

e.  Rolling a die to see if it is fair.

**Solution:**

In this case you are not sure the die is fair. The only way to
determine if it is fair is to actually conduct the experiment, since
you don't know if the outcomes are equally likely. If the
experimental probabilities are fairly close to the theoretical
probabilities, then the die is fair.

If the outcomes are not equally likely, then you must do experimental
probabilities. If the outcomes are equally likely, then you can do
theoretical probabilities.

**Theoretical Probabilities:** If the outcomes of an experiment are
equally likely, then the probability of event A happening is

**Example \#4.2.2: Calculating Theoretical Probabilities**

> Suppose you conduct an experiment where you flip a fair coin twice

a.  What is the sample space?

> **Solution:**
>
> There are several different sample spaces you can do. One is
>
> SS={0, 1, 2} where you are counting the number of heads. However, the
> outcomes are not equally likely since you can get one head by getting
> a head on the first flip and a tail on the second or a tail on the

> outcome and only one way to get the other outcomes. Instead it might
> be better to give the sample space as listing what can happen on each
> flip. Let H = head and T = tail, and list which can happen on each
> flip.
>
> SS={HH, HT, TH, TT}

b.  What is the probability of getting exactly one head?

**Solution:**

> Let A = getting exactly one head. The event space is A = {HT, TH}. So
>
> .
>
> It may not be advantageous to reduce the fractions to lowest terms,
> since it is easier to compare fractions if they have the same
> denominator.

c.  What is the probability of getting at least one head?

**Solution:**

Let B = getting at least one head. At least one head means get one
or more. The event space is B = {HT, TH, HH} and

Since P(B) is greater than the P(A), then event B is more likely to
happen than event A.

d.  What is the probability of getting a head and a tail?

**Solution:**

Let C = getting a head and a tail = {HT, TH} and

This is the same event space as event A, but it is a different
event. Sometimes two different events can give the same event space.

e.  What is the probability of getting a head or a tail?

**Solution:**

> Let D = getting a head or a tail. Since or means one or the other or
> both and it doesn't specify the number of heads or tails, then D =
> {HH, HT, TH, TT} and

f.  What is the probability of getting a foot?

**Solution:**

Let E = getting a foot. Since you can't get a foot, E = {} or the
empty set and

g.  What is the probability of each outcome? What is the sum of these
probabilities?

**Solution:**

. If you add all of these probabilities together you get 1.

This example had some results in it that are important concepts. They
are summarized below:

> **Probability Properties**

> 1.

> event
>
> 3\. If the P(event) = 0, then it cannot happen and is called the
> impossible event
>
> 4.

**Example \#4.2.3: Calculating Theoretical Probabilities**

> Suppose you conduct an experiment where you pull a card from a
> standard deck.

a.  What is the sample space?

**Solution:**

SS = {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS, 2C, 3C,
4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, AC, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D,
8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD, KD, AD, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H,
JH, QH, KH, AH}

b.  What is the probability of getting a Spade?

**Solution:**

> Let A = getting a spade = {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS,
> QS, KS, AS} so

c.  What is the probability of getting a Jack?

**Solution:**

Let B = getting a Jack = {JS, JC, JH, JD} so

d.  What is the probability of getting an Ace?

**Solution:**

> Let C = getting an Ace = {AS, AC, AH, AD} so

e.  What is the probability of not getting an Ace?

**Solution:**

Let D = not getting an Ace = {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S,
JS, QS, KS, 2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, 2D, 3D,
4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD, KD, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H,
9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH} so

Notice, , so you could have found the probability of D by doing 1
minus the probability of C

f.  What is the probability of getting a Spade and an Ace?

**Solution:**

Let E = getting a Spade and an Ace = {AS} so

g.  What is the probability of getting a Spade or an Ace?

**Solution:**

Let F = getting a Spade and an Ace ={2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S,
10S, JS, QS, KS, AS, AC, AD, AH} so

h.  What is the probability of getting a Jack and an Ace?

**Solution:**

Let G = getting a Jack and an Ace = { } since you can't do that with
one card. So

i.  What is the probability of getting a Jack or an Ace?

**Solution:**

> Let H = getting a Jack or an Ace = {JS, JC, JD, JH, AS, AC, AD, AH} so

**Example \#4.2.4: Calculating Theoretical Probabilities**

> Suppose you have an iPod Shuffle with the following songs on it: 5
> Rolling Stones songs, 7 Beatles songs, 9 Bob Dylan songs, 4 Faith Hill
> songs, 2 Taylor Swift songs, 7 U2 songs, 4 Mariah Carey songs, 7 Bob
> Marley songs, 6 Bunny Wailer songs, 7 Elton John songs, 5 Led Zeppelin
> songs, and 4 Dave Mathews Band songs. The different genre that you

> Wailer; rock of the 70s includes Elton John and Led Zeppelin; and
> bluegrasss/rock includes Dave Mathews Band.
>
> The way an iPod Shuffle works, is it randomly picks the next song so

> write out, but you can figure it from looking at the number in each
> set and the total number. The total number of songs you have is 67.

a.  What is the probability that you will hear a Faith Hill song?

**Solution:**

There are 4 Faith Hill songs out of the 67 songs, so

b.  What is the probability that you will hear a Bunny Wailer song?

**Solution:**

There are 6 Bunny Wailer songs, so

c.  What is the probability that you will hear a song from the 60s?

**Solution:**

> There are 5, 7, and 9 songs that are classified as rock from the 60s,
> which is 21 total, so

d.  What is the probability that you will hear a Reggae song?

**Solution:**

There are 6 and 7 songs that are classified as Reggae, which is 13
total, so

e.  What is the probability that you will hear a song from the 90s or a
bluegrass/rock song?

**Solution:**

There are 7 and 4 songs that are songs from the 90s and 4 songs that
are bluegrass/rock, for a total of 15, so

f.  What is the probability that you will hear an Elton John or a Taylor
Swift song?

**Solution:**

There are 7 Elton John songs and 2 Taylor Swift songs, for a total
of 9, so

g.  What is the probability that you will hear a country song or a U2
song?

**Solution:**

There are 6 country songs and 7 U2 songs, for a total of 13, so

> Of course you can do any other combinations you would like.

Notice in example \#4.2.3 part e, it was mentioned that the probability
of event D plus the probability of event C was 1. This is because these
two events have no outcomes in common, and together they make up the
entire sample space. Events that have this property are called
**complementary events**.

If two events are **complementary events** then to find the probability
of one just subtract the probability of the other from one. Notation
used for complement of A is not A or , or .

**\
**

**Example \#4.2.5: Complementary Events**

a.  Suppose you know that the probability of it raining today is 0.45.
What is the probability of it not raining?

**Solution:**

> Since not raining is the complement of raining, then

b.  Suppose you know the probability of not getting the flu is 0.24.
What is the probability of getting the flu?

**Solution:**

> Since getting the flu is the complement of not getting the flu, then

c.  In an experiment of picking a card from a deck, what is the
probability of not getting a card that is a Queen?

**Solution:**

You could do this problem by listing all the ways to not get a
queen, but that set is fairly large. One advantage of the complement
is that it reduces the workload. You use the complement in many
situations to make the work shorter and easier. In this case it is
easier to list all the ways to get a Queen, find the probability of
the Queen, and then subtract from one.

Queen = {QS, QC, QD, QH} so

and

The complement is useful when you are trying to find the probability of
an event that involves the words at least or an event that involves the
words at most. As an example of an at least event is suppose you want to
find the probability of making at least \$50,000 when you graduate from
college. That means you want the probability of your salary being
greater than or equal to \$50,000. An example of an at most event is
suppose you want to find the probability of rolling a die and getting at
most a 4. That means that you want to get less than or equal to a 4 on
the die. The reason to use the complement is that sometimes it is easier
to find the probability of the complement and then subtract from 1.
Example \#4.2.6 demonstrates how to do this.

**\
**

**Example \#4.2.6: Using the Complement to Find Probabilities**

a.  In an experiment of rolling a fair die one time, find the
probability of rolling at most a 4 on the die.

**Solution:**

The sample space for this experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. You want
the event of getting at most a 4, which is the same as thinking of
getting 4 or less. The event space is {1, 2, 3, 4}. The probability
is

Or you could have used the complement. The complement of rolling at
most a 4 would be rolling number bigger than 4. The event space for
the complement is {5, 6}. The probability of the complement is . The
probability of at most 4 would be

Notice you have the same answer, but the event space was easier to
write out. On this example it probability wasn't that useful, but in
the future there will be events where it is much easier to use the
complement.

b.  In an experiment of pulling a card from a fair deck, find the
probability of pulling at least a 5 (ace is a high card in this
example).

**Solution:**

The sample space for this experiment is

SS = {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS, 2C, 3C,
4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, AC, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D,
8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD, KD, AD, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H,
JH, QH, KH, AH}

Pulling a card that is at least a 5 would involve listing all of the
cards that are a 5 or more. It would be much easier to list the
outcomes that make up the complement. The complement of at least a 5
is less than a 5. That would be the event of 4 or less. The event
space for the complement would be {2S, 3S, 4S, 2C, 3C, 4C, 2D, 3D,
4D, 2H, 3H, 4H}. The probability of the complement would be . The
probability of at least a 5 would be

Another concept was show in example \#4.2.3 parts g and i. The problems
were looking for the probability of one event or another. In part g, it
was looking for the probability of getting a Spade or an Ace. That was
equal to . In part i, it was looking for the probability of getting a
Jack or an Ace. That was equal to . If you look back at the parts b, c,
and d, you might notice the following result:

> but .

Why does adding two individual probabilities together work in one
situation to give the probability of one or another event and not give
the correct probability in the other?

The reason this is true in the case of the Jack and the Ace is that
these two events cannot happen together. There is no overlap between the
two events, and in fact the ![](media/image46.emf). However, in the case
of the Spade and Ace, they can happen together. There is overlap, mainly
the ace of spades. The .

When two events cannot happen at the same time, they are called
**mutually exclusive**. In the above situation, the events Jack and Ace
are mutually exclusive, while the events Spade and Ace are not mutually
exclusive.

**Addition Rules:**

If two events A and B are mutually exclusive, then

and

If two events A and B are not mutually exclusive, then

**Example \#4.2.7: Using Addition Rules**

> Suppose your experiment is to roll two fair dice.

a.  What is the sample space?

**Solution:**

As with the other examples you need to come up with a sample space
that has equally likely outcomes. One sample space is to list the
sums possible on each roll. That sample space would look like: SS =
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}. However, there are more ways
to get a sum of 7 then there are to get a sum of 2, so these
outcomes are not equally likely. Another thought is to list the
possibilities on each roll. As an example you could roll the dice
and on the first die you could get a 1. The other die could be any
number between 1 and 6, but say it is a 1 also. Then this outcome
would look like (1,1). Similarly, you could get (1, 2), (1, 3),
(1,4), (1, 5), or (1, 6). Also, you could get a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 on
the first die instead. Putting this all together, you get the sample
space:

SS = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),

(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),

(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6),

(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),

(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6),

(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}

Notice that a (2,3) is different from a (3,2), since the order that
you roll the die is important and you can tell the difference
between these two outcomes. You don't need any of the doubles twice,
since these are not distinguishable from each other in either order.

This will always be the sample space for rolling two dice.

b.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 5?

**Solution:**

> Let A = getting a sum of 5 = {(4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4)} so

c.  What is the probability of getting the first die a 2?

**Solution:**

Let B = getting first die a 2 = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5),
(2,6)} so

d.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 7?

**Solution:**

Let C = getting a sum of 7 = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,3), (3,4), (2,5),
(1,6)} so

e.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 5 and the first die a 2?

**Solution:**

This is events A and B which contains the outcome {(2,3)} so

f.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 5 or the first die a 2?

**Solution:**

Notice from part e, that these two events are not mutually
exclusive, so

g.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 5 and sum of 7?

**Solution:**

These are the events A and C, which have no outcomes in common. Thus
A and C = { } so

h.  What is the probability of getting a sum of 5 or sum of 7?

**Solution:**

From part g, these two events are mutually exclusive, so

**Odds**

Many people like to talk about the odds of something happening or not
happening. Mathematicians, statisticians, and scientists prefer to deal
with probabilities since odds are difficult to work with, but gamblers
prefer to work in odds for figuring out how much they are paid if they
win.

The **actual odds against** event *A* occurring are the ratio , usually
expressed in the form *a:b* or *a* to *b*, where *a* and *b* are
integers with no common factors.

The **actual odds in favor** event *A* occurring are the ratio , which
is the reciprocal of the odds against. If the odds against event *A* are
*a:b*, then the odds in favor event *A* are *b:a*.

The **payoff odds** against event *A* occurring are the ratio of the net
profit (if you win) to the amount bet.

payoff odds against event *A* = (net profit) : (amount bet)

**\
**

**Example \#4.2.8: Odds Against and Payoff Odds**

In the game of Craps, if a shooter has a come-out roll of a 7 or an 11,
it is called a natural and the pass line wins. The payoff odds are given
by a casino as 1:1.

a.  Find the probability of a natural.

**Solution:**

> A natural is a 7 or 11. The sample space is

SS = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6),

(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6),

(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6),

(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6),

(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6),

> (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}

The event space is {(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1), (5,6),
(6,5)}

> So

b.  Find the actual odds for a natural.

**Solution:**

c.  Find the actual odds against a natural.

**Solution:**

d.  If the casino pays 1:1, how much profit does the casino make on a
\$10 bet?

**Solution:**

> The actual odds are 3.5 to 1 while the payoff odds are 1 to 1. The
> casino pays you \$10 for your \$10 bet. If the casino paid you the
> actual odds, they would pay \$3.50 on every \$1 bet, and on \$10, they
> pay . Their profit is .

## Conditional Probability

Suppose you want to figure out if you should buy a new car. When you first go and look, you find two cars that you like the most. In your mind they are equal, and so each has a 50% chance that you will pick it. Then you start to look at the reviews of the cars and realize that the first car has had 40% of them needing to be repaired in the first year, while the second car only has 10% of the cars needing to be repaired in the first year. You could use this information to help you decide which car you want to actually purchase. Both cars no longer have a 50% chance of being the car you choose. You could actually calculate the probability you will buy each car, which is a conditional probability. You probably wouldn't do this, but it gives you an example of what a conditional probability is.

**Conditional probabilities** are probabilities calculated after information is given. This is where you want to find the probability of event A happening after you know that event B has happened. If you know that B has happened, then you don't need to consider the rest of the sample space. You only need the outcomes that make up event B. Event B becomes the new sample space, which is called the **restricted sample space, R**. If you always write a restricted sample space when doing conditional probabilities and use this as your sample space, you will have no trouble with conditional probabilities. The notation for conditional probabilities is . The event following the vertical line is always the restricted sample space.

**Example \#4.3.1: Conditional Probabilities**

a.  Suppose you roll two dice. What is the probability of getting a sum
of 5, given that the first die is a 2?

**Solution:**

Since you know that the first die is a 2, then this is your
restricted sample space, so

R = {(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)}

Out of this restricted sample space, the way to get a sum of 5 is
{(2,3)}. Thus

b.  Suppose you roll two dice. What is the probability of getting a sum
of 7, given the first die is a 4?

**Solution:**

Since you know that the first die is a 4, this is your restricted
sample space, so

R = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)}

Out of this restricted sample space, the way to get a sum of 7 is
{(4,3)}.

Thus

c.  Suppose you roll two dice. What is the probability of getting the
second die a 2, given the sum is a 9?

**Solution:**

Since you know the sum is a 9, this is your restricted sample space,
so

R = {(3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3)}

Out of this restricted sample space there is no way to get the
second die a 2. Thus

d.  Suppose you pick a card from a deck. What is the probability of
getting a Spade, given that the card is a Jack?

**Solution:**

Since you know that the card is a Jack, this is your restricted
sample space, so

R = {JS, JC, JD, JH}

Out of this restricted sample space, the way to get a Spade is {JS}.
Thus

e.  Suppose you pick a card from a deck. What is the probability of
getting an Ace, given the card is a Queen?

**Solution:**

Since you know that the card is a Queen, then this is your
restricted sample space, so

R = {QS, QC, QD, QH}

Out of this restricted sample space, there is no way to get an Ace,
thus

If you look at the results of example \#4.2.7 part d and example \#4.3.1
part b, you will notice that you get the same answer. This means that
knowing that the first die is a 4 did not change the probability that
the sum is a 7. This added knowledge did not help you in any way. It is
as if that information was not given at all. However, if you compare
example \#4.2.7 part b and example \#4.3.1 part a, you will notice that
they are not the same answer. In this case, knowing that the first die
is a 2 did change the probability of getting a sum of 5. In the first
case, the events sum of 7 and first die is a 4 are called **independent
events.** In the second case, the events sum of 5 and first die is a 2
are called **dependent events.**

Events A and B are considered **independent events** if the fact that
one event happens does not change the probability of the other event
happening. In other words, events A and B are independent if the fact
that B has happened does not affect the probability of event A happening
and the fact that A has happened does not affect the probability of
event B happening. Otherwise, the two events are dependent.

In symbols, A and B are independent if

> or

**Example \#4.3.2: Independent Events**

a.  Suppose you roll two dice. Are the events "sum of 7" and "first die
is a 3" independent?

**Solution:**

To determine if they are independent, you need to see if .

It doesn't matter which event is A or B, so just assign one as A and
one as B.

Let A = sum of 7 = {(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)} and B
= first die is a 3 = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}

means that you assume that B has happened. The restricted sample
space is B,

R = {(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)}

In this restricted sample space, the way for A to happen is {(3,4)},
so

The

. Thus "sum of 7" and "first die is a 3" are independent events.

b.  Suppose you roll two dice. Are the events "sum of 6" and "first die
is a 4" independent?

**Solution:**

To determine if they are independent, you need to see if .

It doesn't matter which event is A or B, so just assign one as A and
one as B.

Let A = sum of 6 = {(1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1)} and B = first
die is a 4 = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)}, so

For ![](media/image80.emf), the restricted sample space is B,

R = {(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)}

In this restricted sample space, the way for A to happen is {(4,2)},
so

.

In this case, "sum of 6" and "first die is a 4" are dependent since
.

c.  Suppose you pick a card from a deck. Are the events "Jack" and
"Spade" independent?

**Solution:**

To determine if they are independent, you need to see if .

It doesn't matter which event is A or B, so just assign one as A and
one as B.

Let A = Jack = {JS, JC, JD, JH} and B = Spade {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S,
7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS}

For ![](media/image85.emf), the restricted sample space is B,

R = {2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS}

In this restricted sample space, the way A happens is {JS}, so

In this case, "Jack" and "Spade" are independent since

.

d.  Suppose you pick a card from a deck. Are the events "Heart" and
"Red" card independent?

**Solution:**

To determine if they are independent, you need to see if .

It doesn't matter which event is A or B, so just assign one as A and
one as B.

Let A = Heart = {2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH,
AH} and B = Red card = {2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD,
KD, AD, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH, AH}, so

For , the restricted sample space is B,

R = {2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD, KD, AD, 2H, 3H,
4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH, AH}

In this restricted sample space, the way A can happen is 13,

.

In this case, "Heart" and "Red" card are dependent, since .

e.  Suppose you have two children via separate births. Are the events
"the first is a boy" and "the second is a girl" independent?

**Solution:**

In this case, you actually don't need to do any calculations. The
gender of one child does not affect the gender of the second child,
the events are independent.

f.  Suppose you flip a coin 50 times and get a head every time, what is
the probability of getting a head on the next flip?

**Solution:**

> Since one flip of the coin does not affect the next flip (the coin
> does not remember what it did the time before), the probability of
> getting a head on the next flip is still one-half.

**Multiplication Rule:**

Two more useful formulas:

If two events are dependent, then

If two events are independent, then

If you solve the first equation for , you obtain , which is a formula to
calculate a conditional probability. However, it is easier to find a
conditional probability by using the restricted sample space and
counting unless the sample space is large.

**\
**

**Example \#4.3.3: Multiplication Rule**

a.  Suppose you pick three cards from a deck, what is the probability
that they are all Queens if the cards are not replaced after they
are picked?

**Solution:**

This sample space is too large to write out, so using the
multiplication rule makes sense. Since the cards are not replaced,
then the probability will change for the second and third cards.
They are dependent events. This means that on the second draw there
is one less Queen and one less card, and on the third draw there are
two less Queens and 2 less cards.

b.  Suppose you pick three cards from a deck, what is the probability
that they are all Queens if the cards are replaced after they are
picked and before the next card is picked?

**Solution:**

> Again, the sample space is too large to write out, so using the
> multiplication rule makes sense. Since the cards are put back, one
> draw has no affect on the next draw and they are all independent.

a.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from the
Americas.

**Solution: **

There are 36817 cases of leprosy in the Americas out of 222,545
cases worldwide. So,

There is about a 16.5% chance that a person with leprosy lives in a
country in the Americas.

b.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from a
high-income country.

**Solution:**

There are 264 cases of leprosy in high-income countries out of
222,545 cases worldwide. So,

There is about a 0.1% chance that a person with leprosy lives in a
high-income country.

c.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from the Americas
and a high-income country.

**Solution:**

There are 174 cases of leprosy in countries in a high-income country
in the Americas out the 222,545 cases worldwide. So,

There is about a 0.08% chance that a person with leprosy lives in a
high-income country in the Americas.

d.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from a
high-income country, given they are from the Americas.

**Solution:**

In this case you know that the person is in the Americas. You don't
need to consider people from Easter Mediterranean, Europe, Western
Pacific, Africa, and South-east Asia. You only need to look at the
row with Americas at the start. In that row, look to see how many
leprosy cases there are from a high-income country. There are 174
countries out of the 36,817 leprosy cases in the Americas. So,

There is 0.47% chance that a person with leprosy is from a
high-income country given that they are from the Americas.

e.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from a low-income
country.

**Solution:**

There are 27,923 cases of leprosy in low-income countries out of the
222,545 leprosy cases worldwide. So,

There is a 12.5% chance that a person with leprosy is from a
low-income country.

f.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from Africa.

**Solution:**

There are 17,953 cases of leprosy in Africa out of 222,545 leprosy
cases worldwide. So,

There is an 8.1% chance that a person with leprosy is from Africa.

g.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from Africa and a
low-income country.

**Solution:**

There are 15,928 cases of leprosy in low-income countries in Africa
out of all the 222,545 leprosy cases worldwide. So,

There is a 7.2% chance that a person with leprosy is from a
low-income country in Africa.

h.  Find the probability that a person with leprosy is from Africa,
given they are from a low-income country.

**Solution:**

In this case you know that the person with leprosy is from
low-income country. You don't need to include the high income,
upper-middle income, and lower-middle income country. You only need
to consider the column headed by low-income. In that column, there
are 15,928 cases of leprosy in Africa out of the 27,923 cases of
leprosy in low-income countries. So,

There is a 57.0% chance that a person with leprosy is from Africa,
given that they are from a low-income country.

i.  Are the events that a person with leprosy is from "Africa" and
"low-income country" independent events? Why or why not?

**Solution:**

In order for these events to be independent, either or have to be
true. Part (h) showed and part (f) showed . Since these are not
equal, then these two events are dependent.

j.  Are the events that a person with leprosy is from "Americas" and
"high-income country" independent events? Why or why not?

**Solution:**

In order for these events to be independent, either or have to be
true. Part (d) showed and part (b) showed Since these are not equal,
then these two events are dependent.

A big deal has been made about the difference between dependent and
independent events while calculating the probability of *and* compound
events.  You must multiply the probability of the first event with the
conditional probability of the second event.

 

Why do you care?  You need to calculate probabilities when you are
performing sampling, as you will learn later.  But here is a
simplification that can make the calculations a lot easier: when
the sample size is very small compared to the population size, you can
assume that the conditional probabilities just don\'t change very much
over the sample.

 

For example, consider acceptance sampling.  Suppose there is a big
population of parts delivered to you factory, say 12,000 parts.  Suppose
there are 85 defective parts in the population.  You decide to randomly
select ten parts, and reject the shipment.    What is the probability of
rejecting the shipment?  

 

There are many different ways you could reject the shipment.  For
example, maybe the first three parts are good, one is bad, and the rest
are good.  Or all ten parts could be bad, or maybe the first five.  So
many ways to reject!  But there is only ***one*** way that you'd accept
the shipment: if ***all* *ten*** parts are good. That would happen if
the first part is good, **and** the second part is good, **and** the
third part is good, and so on.  Since the probability of the second part
being good is (slightly) dependent on whether the first part was good,
technically you should take this into consideration when you calculate
the probability that all ten are good.

 

The probability of getting the first sampled part good is . So the
probability that all ten being good is .

If instead you assume that the probability doesn't change much, you get
. So as you can see, there is not much difference. So here is the rule:
if the sample is very small compared to the size of the population, then
you can assume that the probabilities are independent, even though they
aren't technically. By the way, the probability of rejecting the
shipment is .

## Counting Techniques

There are times when the sample space or event space are very large, that it isn't feasible to write it out. In that case, it helps to have mathematical tools for counting the size of the sample space and event space. These tools are known as counting techniques.

**Multiplication Rule in Counting Techniques**

If task 1 can be done ways, task 2 can be done ways, and so forth to task *n* being done ways. Then the number of ways to do task 1, 2,..., *n* together would be [MISSING EQN?].

objects matters or if it doesn't. As an example if you are trying to
call a person on the phone, you have to have their number in the right
order. Otherwise, you call someone you didn't mean to. In this case, the
order of the numbers matters. If however you were picking random numbers
for the lottery, it doesn't matter which number you pick first. As long
as you have the same numbers that the lottery people pick, you win. In
this case the order doesn't matter. A **permutation** is an arrangement
of items with a specific order. You use permutations to count items when
the order matters. When the order doesn't matter you use combinations. A
**combination** is an arrangement of items when order is not important.
When you do a counting problem, the first thing you should ask yourself
is "does order matter?"

**Permutation Formula**

Picking *r* objects from *n* total objects when order matters

**Combination Formula**

Picking *r* objects from *n* total objects when order doesn't matter

**Example \#4.4.3: Calculating the Number of Ways**

> In a club with 15 members, how many ways can a slate of 3 officers
> consisting of a president, vice-president, and secretary/treasurer be
> chosen?
>
> **Solution:**
>
> In this case the order matters. If you pick person 1 for president, person 2 for vice-president, and person 3 for secretary/treasurer you would have different officers than if you picked person 2 for president, person 1 for vice-president, and person 3 for secretary/treasurer. This is a permutation problem with and .

**Example \#4.4.4: Calculating the Number of Ways**

> Suppose you want to pick 7 people out of 20 people to take part in a survey. How many ways can you do this?
>
> **Solution:**
>
> In this case the order doesn't matter, since you just want 7 people. This is a combination with and [MISSING].

Most calculators have a factorial button on them, and many have the combination and permutation functions also. R has a combination command.
