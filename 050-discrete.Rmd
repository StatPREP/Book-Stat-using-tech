# Discrete Probability Distributions

## Basics of Probability Distributions

As a reminder, a variable or what will be called the random variable from now on, is represented by the letter *x* and it represents a quantitative (numerical) variable that is measured or observed in an experiment.

Also remember there are different types of quantitative variables, called discrete or continuous. What is the difference between discrete and continuous data? **Discrete** data can only take on particular values in a range. **Continuous** data can take on any value in a range. Discrete data usually arises from counting while continuous data usually arises from measuring.

**Examples of each:**

How tall is a plant given a new fertilizer? Continuous. This is something you measure.

How many fleas are on prairie dogs in a colony? Discrete. This is something you count.

If you have a variable, and can find a probability associated with that variable, it is called a **random variable**. In many cases the random variable is what you are measuring, but when it comes to discrete random variables, it is usually what you are counting. So for the example of how tall is a plant given a new fertilizer, the random variable is the height of the plant given a new fertilizer. For the example of how many fleas are on prairie dogs in a colony, the random variable is the number of fleas on a prairie dog in a colony.

Now suppose you put all the values of the random variable together with the probability that that random variable would occur. You could then have a distribution like before, but now it is called a probability distribution since it involves probabilities. A **probability distribution** is an assignment of probabilities to the values of the random variable. The abbreviation of pdf is used for a probability distribution function.

**Example \#5.1.1: Probability Distribution**

> The 2010 U.S. Census found the chance of a household being a certain
> size. The data is in table \#5.1.1 (\"Households by age,\" 2013).

> **Table \#5.1.1: Household Size from U.S. Census of 2010**

  Size of household   1       2       3       4       5      6      7 or more
  ------------------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------ ------ -----------
  Probability         26.7%   33.6%   15.8%   13.7%   6.3%   2.4%   1.5%

> **Solution:**
>
> In this case, the random variable is *x* = number of people in a household. This is a discrete random variable, since you are unting the number of people in a household.

> This is a probability distribution since you have the *x* value and the probabilities that go with it, all of the probabilities are between zero and one, and the sum of all of the probabilities is one.

You can give a probability distribution in table form (as in table \#5.1.1) or as a graph. The graph looks like a histogram. A probability distribution is basically a relative frequency distribution based on a very large sample. 

**Example \#5.1.2: Graphing a Probability Distribution**

Just as with any data set, you can calculate the mean and standard
deviation. In problems involving a probability distribution function
(pdf), you consider the probability distribution the population even
though the pdf in most cases come from repeating an experiment many
times. This is because you are using the data from repeated experiments
to estimate the true probability. Since a pdf is basically a population,
the mean and standard deviation that are calculated are actually the
population parameters and not the sample statistics. The notation used
is the same as the notation for population mean and population standard
deviation that was used in chapter 3. Note: the mean can be thought of
as the **expected value**. It is the value you expect to get if the
trials were repeated infinite number of times. The mean or expected
value does not need to be a whole number, even if the possible values of
*x* are whole numbers.

For a discrete probability distribution function,

The mean or expected value is

The variance is

The standard deviation is

where *x* = the value of the random variable and *P(x)* = the
probability corresponding to a particular *x* value.

**Example \#5.1.3: Calculating Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation

> **Solution:**
>
> State random variable:
>
> *x* = number of people in a household

a.  Find the mean

> **Solution:**

To find the mean it is easier to just use a table as shown below.
Consider the category 7 or more to just be 7. The formula for the mean
says to multiply the *x* value by the *P(x)* value, so add a row into
the table for this calculation. Also convert all *P(x)* to decimal form.

> **Table \#5.1.4: Calculating the Mean for a Discrete PDF**

  *x*       1       2       3       4       5       6       7
  --------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------
  *P(x) *   0.267   0.336   0.158   0.137   0.063   0.024   0.015
            0.267   0.672   0.474   0.548   0.315   0.144   0.098

> Now add up the new row and you get the answer 2.525. This is the mean
> or the expected value, . This means that you expect a household in the
> U.S. to have 2.525 people in it. Now of course you can't have half a
> person, but what this tells you is that you expect a household to have
> either 2 or 3 people, with a little more 3-person households than
> 2-person households.

b.  Find the variance

> **Solution:**

To find the variance, again it is easier to use a table version than try
to just the formula in a line. Looking at the formula, you will notice
that the first operation that you should do is to subtract the mean from
each *x* value. Then you square each of these values. Then you multiply
each of these answers by the probability of each *x* value. Finally you
add up all of these values.

> **Table \#5.1.5: Calculating the Variance for a Discrete PDF**

  *x*       1        2        3        4        5        6         7
  --------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------- ---------
  *P(x) *   0.267    0.336    0.158    0.137    0.063    0.024     0.015
            -1.525   -0.525   0.475    1.475    2.475    3.475     4.475
            2.3256   0.2756   0.2256   2.1756   6.1256   12.0756   20.0256
            0.6209   0.0926   0.0356   0.2981   0.3859   0.2898    0.3004

Now add up the last row to find the variance, . (Note: try not to round
your numbers too much so you aren't creating rounding error in your
answer. The numbers in the table above were rounded off because of space
limitations, but the answer was calculated using many decimal places.)

c.  Find the standard deviation

> **Solution:**

To find the standard deviation, just take the square root of the
variance, . This means that you can expect a U.S. household to have
2.525 people in it, with a standard deviation of 1.42 people.

**\
**

d.  Use a TI-83/84 to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

> **Solution:**
>
> Go into the STAT menu, then the Edit menu. Type the *x* values into L1
> and the *P(x)* values into L2. Then go into the STAT menu, then the
> CALC menu. Choose 1:1-Var Stats. This will put 1-Var Stats on the home
> screen. Now type in L1,L2 (there is a comma between L1 and L2) and
> then press ENTER. If you have the newer operating system on the TI-84,
> then your input will be slightly different. You will see the output in

> The mean is 2.525 people and the standard deviation is 1.422 people.

e.  Using R to calculate the mean.

> **Solution:**
>
> The command would be weighted.mean(x, p). So for this example, the
> process would look like:
>
> x\<-c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

> Output:

> \[1\] 2.525
>
> So the mean is 2.525.

**Example \#5.1.4: Calculating the Expected Value**

> In the Arizona lottery called Pick 3, a player pays \$1 and then picks
> a three-digit number. If those three numbers are picked in that
> specific order the person wins \$500. What is the expected value in

>
> **Solution:**
>
> To find the expected value, you need to first create the probability

> pick the right numbers in the right order, then you win \$500, but you
> paid \$1 to play, so you actually win \$499. If you didn't pick the
> right numbers, you lose the \$1, the *x* value is . You also need the
> probability of winning and losing. Since you are picking a three-digit

> **Table \#5.1.6: Finding Expected Value**

  Win or lose   *x*     *P(x)*   
  ------------- ------- -------- ---------
  Win           \$499   0.001    \$0.499
  Lose                  0.999

The reason probability is studied in statistics is to help in making
decisions in inferential statistics. To understand how that is done the
concept of a rare event is needed.

**Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics**

If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed
event is extremely small, then you can conclude that the assumption is
probably not correct.

An example of this is suppose you roll an assumed fair die 1000 times
and get a six 600 times, when you should have only rolled a six around
160 times, then you should believe that your assumption about it being a
fair die is untrue.

**Determining if an event is unusual**

If you are looking at a value of x for a discrete variable, and the
*P*(the variable has a value of x or more) \< 0.05, then you can
consider the x an unusually high value.  Another way to think of this is
if the probability of getting such a high value is less than 0.05, then
the event of getting the value x is unusual.

Similarly, if the *P*(the variable has a value of x or less) \< 0.05,
then you can consider this an unusually low value. Another way to think
of this is if the probability of getting a value as small as x is less
than 0.05, then the event x is considered unusual.

Why is it \"x or more\" or \"x or less\" instead of just \"x\" when you
are determining if an event is unusual? Consider this example: you and
your friend go out to lunch every day.  Instead of Going Dutch (each
paying for their own lunch), you decide to flip a coin, and the loser
pays for both.  Your friend seems to be winning more often than you\'d
expect, so you want to determine if this is unusual before you decide to
change how you pay for lunch (or accuse your friend of cheating).  The
process for how to calculate these probabilities will be presented in
the next section on the binomial distribution.  If your friend won 6 out
of 10 lunches, the probability of that happening turns out to be about
20.5%, not unusual.  The probability of winning 6 or more is about
37.7%.  But what happens if your friend won 501 out of 1,000 lunches? 
That doesn\'t seem so unlikely!  The probability of winning 501 or more
lunches is about 47.8%, and that is consistent with your hunch that this
isn\'t so unusual.  But the probability of winning exactly 501 lunches
is much less, only about 2.5%.  That is why the probability of getting
exactly that value is not the right question to ask: you should ask the
probability of getting that value or more (or that value or less on the
other side).

The value 0.05 will be explained later, and it is not the only value you
can use.

**Example \#5.1.5: Is the Event Unusual**

> The 2010 U.S. Census found the chance of a household being a certain
> size. The data is in the table (\"Households by age,\" 2013).

> **Table \#5.1.7: Household Size from U.S. Census of 2010**

  Size of household   1       2       3       4       5      6      7 or more

  Probability         26.7%   33.6%   15.8%   13.7%   6.3%   2.4%   1.5%

> *x* = number of people in a household

a.  Is it unusual for a household to have six people in the family?

    **Solution:**

To determine this, you need to look at probabilities. However, you
cannot just look at the probability of six people. You need to look at
the probability of *x* being six or more people or the probability of
*x* being six or less people. The

> Since this probability is more than 5%, then six is not an unusually

>
> The
>
> Since this probability is less than 5%, then six is an unusually high
> value. It is unusual for a household to have six people in the family.

b.  If you did come upon many families that had six people in the
    family, what would you think?

    **Solution:**

    Since it is unusual for a family to have six people in it, then you
    may think that either the size of families is increasing from what
    it was or that you are in a location where families are larger than
    in other locations.

c.  Is it unusual for a household to have four people in the family?

    **Solution:**

    To determine this, you need to look at probabilities. Again, look at
    the probability of *x* being four or more or the probability of *x*
    being four or less. The

    Since this probability is more than 5%, four is not an unusually
    high value.

    The

    Since this probability is more than 5%, four is not an unusually low
    value. Thus, four is not an unusual size of a family.

d.  If you did come upon a family that has four people in it, what would
    you think?

    **Solution:**

    Since it is not unusual for a family to have four members, then you
    would not think anything is amiss.

## Binomial Probability Distribution

Section 5.1 introduced the concept of a probability distribution. The
focus of the section was on discrete probability distributions (pdf). To
find the pdf for a situation, you usually needed to actually conduct the
experiment and collect data. Then you can calculate the experimental
probabilities. Normally you cannot calculate the theoretical
probabilities instead. However, there are certain types of experiment
that allow you to calculate the theoretical probability. One of those
types is called a **Binomial Experiment**.

Properties of a **binomial experiment** (or Bernoulli trial):

1\) Fixed number of trials, *n*, which means that the experiment is
repeated a specific number of times.

2\) The *n* trials are independent, which means that what happens on one
trial does not influence the outcomes of other trials.

3\) There are only two outcomes, which are called a success and a
failure.

4\) The probability of a success doesn't change from trial to trial,
where *p* = probability of success and *q* = probability of failure, .

If you know you have a binomial experiment, then you can calculate
binomial probabilities. This is important because binomial probabilities
come up often in real life. Examples of binomial experiments are:

> Toss a fair coin ten times, and find the probability of getting two
> heads.
>
> Question twenty people in class, and look for the probability of more
> than half being women?
>
> Shoot five arrows at a target, and find the probability of hitting it
> five times?

To develop the process for calculating the probabilities in a binomial
experiment, consider example \#5.2.1.

**Example \#5.2.1: Deriving the Binomial Probability Formula**

a.  What is the random variable?

**Solution:**

> *x* = number of correct answers

b.  Is this a binomial experiment?

**Solution:**

1.  There are 3 questions, and each question is a trial, so there are a
    fixed number of trials. In this case, *n* = 3.

2.  Getting the first question right has no affect on getting the second
    or third question right, thus the trials are independent.

3.  Either you get the question right or you get it wrong, so there are
    only two outcomes. In this case, the success is getting the question
    right.

4.  The probability of getting a question right is one out of four. This
    is the same for every trial since each question has 4 responses. In
    this case, and

First, the random variable in a binomial experiment is *x* = number of
successes.

Be careful, a success is not always a good thing. Sometimes a success is
something that is bad, like finding a defect. A success just means you
observed the outcome you wanted to see happen.

Binomial Formula for the probability of *r* successes in *n* trials is

where

The is the number of combinations of *n* things taking *r* at a time. It
is read "*n* choose *r*". Some other common notations for *n* choose *r*
are , and . *n!* means you are multiplying . As an example, .

When solving problems, make sure you define your random variable and
state what *n*, *p*, *q*, and *r* are. Without doing this, the problems
are a great deal harder.

**Example \#5.2.2: Calculating Binomial Probabilities**

> When looking at a person's eye color, it turns out that 1% of people
> in the world has green eyes (\"What percentage of,\" 2013). Consider a
> group of 20 people.

a.  State the random variable.

**Solution:**

*x* = number of people with green eyes

b.  Argue that this is a binomial experiment

**Solution:**

1.  There are 20 people, and each person is a trial, so there are a
    fixed number of trials. In this case, *n* = 20.

2.  If you assume that each person in the group is chosen at random the
    eye color of one person doesn't affect the eye color of the next
    person, thus the trials are independent.

3.  Either a person has green eyes or they do not have green eyes, so
    there are only two outcomes. In this case, the success is a person
    has green eyes.

4.  The probability of a person having green eyes is 0.01. This is the
    same for every trial since each person has the same chance of having
    green eyes. and

Find the probability that

c.  None have green eyes.

**Solution:**

d.  Nine have green eyes.

**Solution:**

e.  At most three have green eyes.

**Solution:**

At most three means that three is the highest value you will have. Find
the probability of *x* is less than or equal to three.

The reason the answer is written as being greater than 0.999 is because
the answer is actually 0.9999573791, and when that is rounded to three
decimal places you get 1. But 1 means that the event will happen, when
in reality there is a slight chance that it won't happen. It is best to
write the answer as greater than 0.999 to represent that the number is
very close to 1, but isn't 1.

f.  At most two have green eyes.

**Solution:**

g.  At least four have green eyes.

**Solution:**

At least four means four or more. Find the probability of x being
greater than or equal to four. That would mean adding up all the
probabilities from four to twenty. This would take a long time, so it is
better to use the idea of complement. The complement of being greater
than or equal to four is being less than four. That would mean being
less than or equal to three. Part (e) has the answer for the probability
of being less than or equal to three. Just subtract that number from 1.

.

Actually the answer is less than 0.001, but it is fine to write it this
way.

h.  In Europe, four people out of twenty have green eyes. Is this
    unusual? What does that tell you?

**Solution:**

Since the probability of finding four or more people with green eyes is
much less than 0.05, it is unusual to find four people out of twenty
with green eyes. That should make you wonder if the proportion of people
in Europe with green eyes is more than the 1% for the general
population. If this is true, then you may want to ask why Europeans have
a higher proportion of green-eyed people. That of course could lead to
more questions.

The binomial formula is cumbersome to use, so you can find the
probabilities by using technology. On the TI-83/84 calculator, the
commands on the TI-83/84 calculators when the number of trials is equal
to *n* and the probability of a success is equal to *p* are when you
want to find and when you want to find . If you want to find , then you
use the property that , since and are complementary events. Both
binompdf and binomcdf commands are found in the DISTR menu. Using R, the
commands are and .

**Example \#5.2.3: Using the Binomial Command on the TI-83/84**

> When looking at a person's eye color, it turns out that 1% of people
> in the world has green eyes (\"What percentage of,\" 2013). Consider a
> group of 20 people.

a.  State the random variable.

**Solution:**

*x* = number of people with green eyes

> Find the probability that

b.  None have green eyes.

**Solution:**

You are looking for . Since this problem is , you use the binompdf
command on the TI-83/84 or dbinom command on R. On the TI-83/84, you go
to the DISTR menu, select the binompdf, and then type into the
parenthesis your *n*, *p*, and *r* values into your calculator, making
sure you use the comma to separate the values. The command will look
like and when you press ENTER you will be given the answer. (If you have
the new software on the TI-84, the screen looks a bit different.)

**Figure \#5.2.1: Calculator Results for binompdf**

![](media/image62.png){width="2.75in" height="1.8611111111111112in"}

On R, the command would look like dbinom(0, 20, 0.01)

. Thus there is an 81.8% chance that in a group of 20 people none of
them will have green eyes.

c.  Nine have green eyes.

**Solution:**

In this case you want to find the . Again, you will use the binompdf
command or the dbinom command. Following the procedure above, you will
have on the TI-83/84 or dbinom(9,20,0.01) on R. Your answer is .
(Remember when the calculator gives you and R give you , this is how
they display scientific notation.) The probability that out of twenty
people, nine of them have green eyes is a very small chance.

d.  At most three have green eyes.

**Solution:**

At most three means that three is the highest value you will have. Find
the probability of *x* being less than or equal to three, which is .
This uses the binomcdf command on the TI-83/84 and pbinom command in R.
You use the command on the TI-83/84 of and the command on R of
pbinom(3,20,0.01)

**Figure \#5.2.2: Calculator Results for binomcdf**

![](media/image71.png){width="2.75in" height="1.8611111111111112in"}

Your answer is 0.99996. Thus there is a really good chance that in a
group of 20 people at most three will have green eyes. (Note: don't
round this to one, since one means that the event will happen, when in
reality there is a slight chance that it won't happen. It is best to
write the answer out to enough decimal points so it doesn't round off to
one.

e.  At most two have green eyes.

**Solution:**

You are looking for . Again use binomcdf or pbinom. Following the
procedure above you will have on the TI-83/84 and pbinom(2,20,0.01),
with . Again there is a really good chance that at most two people in
the room will have green eyes.

f.  At least four have green eyes.

**Solution:**

At least four means four or more. Find the probability of *x* being
greater than or equal to four. That would mean adding up all the
probabilities from four to twenty. This would take a long time, so it is
better to use the idea of complement. The complement of being greater
than or equal to four is being less than four. That would mean being
less than or equal to three. Part (e) has the answer for the probability
of being less than or equal to three. Just subtract that number from 1.

. You can also find this answer by doing the following on TI-83/84:

on R:

Again, this is very unlikely to happen.

There are other technologies that will compute binomial probabilities.

**Example \#5.2.4: Calculating Binomial Probabilities**

> According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), about 1 in 88
> children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with autism (\"CDC-data and
> statistics,,\" 2013). Suppose you consider a group of 10 children.

a.  State the random variable.

**Solution:**

*x* = number of children with autism.

b.  Argue that this is a binomial experiment

**Solution:**

1.  There are 10 children, and each child is a trial, so there are a
    fixed number of trials. In this case, *n* = 10.

2.  If you assume that each child in the group is chosen at random, then
    whether a child has autism does not affect the chance that the next
    child has autism. Thus the trials are independent.

3.  Either a child has autism or they do not have autism, so there are
    two outcomes. In this case, the success is a child has autism.

4.  The probability of a child having autism is 1/88. This is the same
    for every trial since each child has the same chance of having
    autism. and .

> Find the probability that

c.  None have autism.

**Solution:**

Using the formula:

Using the TI-83/84 Calculator:

Using R:

d.  Seven have autism.

**Solution:**

Using the formula:

Using the TI-83/84 Calculator:

Using R:

e.  At least five have autism.

**Solution:**

Using the formula:

Using the TI-83/84 Calculator:

To use the calculator you need to use the complement.

Using R:

To use R you need to use the complement.

Notice, the answer is given as 0.000, since the answer is less than
0.000. Don't write 0, since 0 means that the event is impossible to
happen. The event of five or more is improbable, but not impossible.

f.  At most two have autism.

**Solution:**

Using the formula:

Using the TI-83/84 Calculator:

Using R:

g.  Suppose five children out of ten have autism. Is this unusual? What
    does that tell you?

**Solution:**

Since the probability of five or more children in a group of ten having
autism is much less than 5%, it is unusual to happen. If this does
happen, then one may think that the proportion of children diagnosed
with autism is actually more than 1/88.

## Mean and Standard Deviation of Binomial Distribution

If you list all possible values of *x* in a Binomial distribution, you get the **Binomial Probability Distribution** (pdf). You can draw a histogram of the pdf and find the mean, variance, and standard deviation of it.

For a general discrete probability distribution, you can find the mean, the variance, and the standard deviation for a pdf using the general formulas [MISSING EQ?]

> , , and .

These formulas are useful, but if you know the type of distribution, like Binomial, then you can find the mean and standard deviation using easier formulas. They are derived from the general formulas.

For a Binomial distribution, , the expected number of successes, , the
variance, and , the standard deviation for the number of success are
given by the formulas:

Where *p* is the probability of success and .

**Example \#5.3.1: Finding the Probability Distribution, Mean, Variance,
and Standard Deviation of a Binomial Distribution**

> When looking at a person's eye color, it turns out that 1% of people in the world has green eyes (\"What percentage of,\" 2013). Consider a group of 20 people.

a.  State the random variable.

    **Solution:**

    x = number of people who have green eyes

b.  Write the probability distribution.

    **Solution:**

    In this case you need to write each value of *x* and its
    corresponding probability. It is easiest to do this by using the
    binompdf command, but don't put in the *r* value. You may want to
    set your calculator to only three decimal places, so it is easier to
    see the values and you don't need much more precision than that. The
    command would look like .

    This produces the information in table \#5.3.1

    **Table \#5.3.1: Probability Distribution for Number of People with
    Green Eyes**

  *x*   
  ----- -------
  0     0.818
  1     0.165
  2     0.016
  3     0.001
  4     0.000
  5     0.000
  6     0.000
  7     0.000
  8     0.000
  9     0.000
  10    0.000
        
  20    0.000

Notice that after x = 4, the probability values are all 0.000. This just
means they are really small numbers.

c.  Draw a histogram.
    
    **Solution:**

    You can draw the histogram on the TI-83/84 or other technology. The
    graph would look like in figure \#5.3.1.

    **Figure \#5.3.1: Histogram Created on TI-83/84**

    ![](media/image142.png){width="2.75in"
    height="1.8611111111111112in"}

    This graph is very skewed to the right.

d.  Find the mean.
    
    **Solution:**

Since this is a binomial, then you can use the formula . So

You expect on average that out of 20 people, less than 1 would have green eyes.

e.  Find the variance.

    **Solution:**

Since this is a binomial, then you can use the formula .

f.  Find the standard deviation.

    **Solution:**

Once you have the variance, you just take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation.
