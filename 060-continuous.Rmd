# Continuous Probability Distributions

Chapter 5 dealt with probability distributions arising from discrete random variables. Mostly that chapter focused on the binomial experiment. There are many other experiments from discrete random variables that exist but are not covered in this book.

Chapter 6 deals with probability distributions that arise from continuous random variables. The focus of this chapter is a distribution known as the normal distribution, though realize that there are many other distributions that exist. A few others are examined in future chapters.

## Uniform Distribution

If you have a situation where the probability is always the same, then this is known as a uniform distribution. An example would be waiting for a commuter train. The commuter trains on the Blue and Green Lines for the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in Cleveland, OH, have a waiting time during peak hours of ten minutes (\"2012 annual report,\" 2012). If you are waiting for a train, you have anywhere from zero minutes to ten minutes to wait. Your probability of having to wait any number of minutes in that interval is the same. This is a uniform distribution. The graph of this distribution is in figure \#6.1.1.

**Figure \#6.1.1: Uniform Distribution Graph**

> ![](media/image1.png){width="3.388888888888889in"
> height="1.8738560804899387in"}

Suppose you want to know the probability that you will have to wait between five and ten minutes for the next train. You can look at the probability graphically such as in figure \#6.1.2.


**Figure \#6.1.2: Uniform Distribution with P(5 \< x \< 10)**

> height="1.858497375328084in"}

How would you find this probability? Calculus says that the probability is the area under the curve. Notice that the shape of the shaded area is a rectangle, and the area of a rectangle is length times width. The length is and the width is 0.1. The probability is , where and *x* is the waiting time during peak hours.

**Example \#6.1.1: Finding Probabilities in a Uniform Distribution**

> The commuter trains on the Blue and Green Lines for the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in Cleveland, OH, have a waiting time during peak rush hour periods of ten minutes (\"2012 annual report,\" 2012).

    minutes for a train.

    minutes for a train.

e.  Find the probability of waiting exactly five minutes.

Notice that in example \#6.1.1d, the probability is equal to one. This
is because the probability that was computed is the area under the
entire curve. Just like in discrete probability distributions, where the
total probability was one, the probability of the entire curve is one.
This is the reason that the height of the curve is 0.1. In general, the
height of a uniform distribution that ranges between *a* and *b*, is .

## Graphs of the Normal Distribution

Many real life problems produce a histogram that is a symmetric, unimodal, and bell-shaped continuous probability distribution. For example: height, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. However, not every bell shaped curve is a normal curve. In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its "height" and its "width."

Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at , the population mean. Figure \#6.2.1 shows two different normal curves drawn on the same scale. Both have but the one on the left has a standard deviation of 10 and the one on the right has a standard deviation of 5. Notice that the larger standard deviation makes the graph wider (more spread out) and shorter.

**Figure \#6.2.1: Different Normal Distribution Graphs**

![](media/image12.png){width="2.5in" height="1.5138888888888888in"}
![](media/image13.png){width="2.375in" height="1.5555555555555556in"}

Every normal curve has common features. These are detailed in figure
\#6.2.2.

**Figure \#6.2.2: Typical Graph of a Normal Curve**

![](media/image14.png){width="6.0in" height="2.388888888888889in"}

-   The center, or the highest point, is at the population mean, .

-   The transition points (inflection points) are the places where the
    curve changes from a "hill" to a "valley". The distance from the
    mean to the transition point is one standard deviation, .

-   The area under the whole curve is exactly 1. Therefore, the area
    under the half below or above the mean is 0.5.

The equation that creates this curve is .

Just as in a discrete probability distribution, the object is to find
the probability of an event occurring. However, unlike in a discrete
probability distribution where the event can be a single value, in a
continuous probability distribution the event must be a range. You are
interested in finding the probability of *x* occurring in the range
between *a* and *b*, or . Calculus tells us that to find this you find
the area under the curve above the interval from *a* to *b*.

> is the area under the curve above the interval from *a* to *b*.

Before looking at the process for finding the probabilities under the
normal curve, it is somewhat useful to look at the **Empirical Rule**
that gives approximate values for these areas. The Empirical Rule is
just an approximation and it will only be used in this section to give
you an idea of what the size of the probabilities is for different
shadings. A more precise method for finding probabilities for the normal
curve will be demonstrated in the next section. Please do not use the
empirical rule except for real rough estimates.

**The Empirical Rule** for any normal distribution:

Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the
mean.

Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the
mean.

Approximately 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of
the mean.

![](media/image21.png){width="5.027777777777778in"
height="2.4166666666666665in"}

Be careful, there is still some area left over in each end. Remember,
the maximum a probability can be is 100%, so if you calculate you will
see that for both ends together there is 0.3% of the curve. Because of
symmetry, you can divide this equally between both ends and find that
there is 0.15% in each tail beyond the .

## Finding Probabilities for the Normal Distribution

The Empirical Rule is just an approximation and only works for certain values. What if you want to find the probability for *x* values that are not integer multiples of the standard deviation? The probability is the area under the curve. To find areas under the curve, you need calculus. Before technology, you needed to convert every *x* value to a standardized number, called the *z*-score or *z-*value or simply just *z*. The *z*-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an *x* value is from the mean. To convert from a normally distributed *x* value to a *z*-score, you use the following formula.

***z*-score**

where = mean of the population of the *x* value and = standard deviation for the population of the *x* value

The *z*-score is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is known as the standard normal curve. Once you have the *z-*score, you can look up the *z-*score in the standard normal distribution table.

The **standard normal distribution, *z*,** has a mean of and a standard deviation of [MISSING EQ?].

**Figure \#6.3.1: Standard Normal Curve**

![](media/image29.png){width="4.527777777777778in"
height="2.3194444444444446in"}

Luckily, these days technology can find probabilities for you without converting to the *z*-score and looking the probabilities up in a table. There are many programs available that will calculate the probability for a normal curve including Excel and the TI-83/84. There are also online sites available. The following examples show how to do the calculation on the TI-83/84 and with R. The command on the TI-83/84 is in the DISTR menu and is normalcdf(. You then type in the lower limit, upper limit, mean, standard deviation in that order and including the commas. The command on R to find the area to the left is pnorm(z-value or x-value, mean, standard deviation).

## Assessing Normality

The distributions you have seen up to this point have been assumed to be normally distributed, but how do you determine if it is normally distributed. One way is to take a sample and look at the sample to determine if it appears normal. If the sample looks normal, then most likely the population is also. Here are some guidelines that are use to help make that determination.

1.  **Histogram:** Make a histogram. For a normal distribution, the     histogram should be roughly bell-shaped. For small samples, this is     not very accurate, and another method is needed. A distribution may     not look normally distributed from the histogram, but it still may     be normally distributed.

2.  **Outliers:** For a normal distribution, there should not be more     than one outlier. One way to check for outliers is to use a modified     box plot. Outliers are values that are shown as dots outside of the     rest of the values. If you don't have a modified box plot, outliers     are those data values that are:

> Above *Q3*, the third quartile, by an amount greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (*IQR*)
>
> Below *Q1*, the first quartile, by an amount greater than 1.5 times the interquartile range (*IQR*)
>
> Note: if there is one outlier, that outlier could have a dramatic effect on the results especially if it is an extreme outlier. However, there are times where a distribution has more than one outlier, but it is still normally distributed. The guideline of only one outlier is just a guideline.

3.  **Normal quantile plot (or normal probability plot):** This plot is     provided through statistical software on a computer or graphing     calculator. If the points lie close to a line, the data comes from a     distribution that is approximately normal. If the points do not lie     close to a line or they show a pattern that is not a line, the data     are likely to come from a distribution that is not normally     distributed.

5.  You will see a new window. The first thing you want to do is turn
    the plot on. At this point you should be on On, just press ENTER. It
    will make On dark.

6.  Now arrow down to Type: and arrow right to the graph that looks like
    a histogram (3^rd^ one from the left in the top row).

7.  Now arrow down to Xlist. Make sure this says L1. If it doesn't, then
    put L1 there (2^nd^ number 1). Freq: should be a 1.

8.  Now you need to set up the correct window to graph on. Click on
    WINDOW. You need to set up the settings for the *x* variable. Xmin
    should be your smallest data value. Xmax should just be a value
    sufficiently above your highest data value, but not too high. Xscl
    is your class width that you calculated. Ymin should be 0 and Ymax
    should be above what you think the highest frequency is going to be.
    You can always change this if you need to. Yscl is just how often
    you would like to see a tick mark on the *y*-axis.

9.  Now press GRAPH. You will see a histogram.

Realize that your random variable may be normally distributed, even if
the sample fails the three tests. However, if the histogram definitely
doesn\'t look symmetric and bell shaped, there are outliers that are
very extreme, and the normal probability plot doesn't look linear, then
you can be fairly confident that the data set does not come from a
population that is normally distributed.

## Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem

You now have most of the skills to start statistical inference, but you need one more concept.

First, it would be helpful to state what statistical inference is in more accurate terms.

**Statistical Inference:** to make accurate decisions about parameters from statistics

When it says "accurate decision," you want to be able to measure how accurate. You measure how accurate using probability. In both binomial and normal distributions, you needed to know that the random variable followed either distribution. You need to know how the statistic is distributed and then you can find probabilities. In other words, you need to know the shape of the sample mean or whatever statistic you want to make a decision about.

How is the statistic distributed? This is answered with a sampling distribution.

**Sampling Distribution:** how a sample statistic is distributed when repeated trials of size *n* are taken.

**Example \#6.5.1: Sampling Distribution**

> Suppose you throw a penny and count how often a head comes up. The random variable is *x* = number of heads. The probability distribution (pdf) of this random variable is presented in figure \#6.5.1.

This depends on how the original distribution is distributed. In Example
\#6.5.1, the random variable was uniform looking. But as *n* increased
to 20, the distribution of the mean looked approximately normal. What if
the original distribution was normal? How big would *n* have to be?
Before that question is answered, another concept is needed.

Suppose you have a random variable that has a population mean, , and a
population standard deviation, . If a sample of size *n* is taken, then
the sample mean, has a mean and standard deviation of . The standard
deviation of is lower because by taking the mean you are averaging out
the extreme values, which makes the distribution of the original random
variable spread out.

You now know the center and the variability of . You also want to know
the shape of the distribution of . You hope it is normal, since you know
how to find probabilities using the normal curve. The following theorem
tells you the requirement to have normally distributed.

**Theorem \#6.5.1: Central Limit Theorem.**

Suppose a random variable is from any distribution. If a sample of size
*n* is taken, then the sample mean, , becomes normally distributed as
*n* increases.

What this says is that no matter what *x* looks like, would look normal
if *n* is large enough. Now, what size of *n* is large enough? That
depends on how *x* is distributed in the first place. If the original
random variable is normally distributed, then *n* just needs to be 2 or
more data points. If the original random variable is somewhat mound
shaped and symmetrical, then *n* needs to be greater than or equal to
30. Sometimes the sample size can be smaller, but this is a good rule of
thumb. The sample size may have to be much larger if the original random
variable is really skewed one way or another.

Now that you know when the sample mean will look like a normal
distribution, then you can find the probability related to the sample
mean. Remember that the mean of the sample mean is just the mean of the
original data (), but the standard deviation of the sample mean, , also
known as the standard error of the mean, is actually . Make sure you use
this in all calculations. If you are using the *z*-score, the formula
when working with is . If you are using the TI-83/84 calculator, then
the input would be . If you are using R, then the input would be for
find the area to the left of . Remember to subtract from 1 if you want
the area to the right of .
