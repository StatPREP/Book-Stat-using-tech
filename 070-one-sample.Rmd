# One-Sample Inference

Now that you have all this information about descriptive statistics and probabilities, it is time to start inferential statistics. There are two branches of inferential statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

**Hypothesis Testing:** making a decision about a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).

**Confidence Interval:** estimating a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).

## Basics of Hypothesis Testing

To understand the process of a hypothesis tests, you need to first have an understanding of what a hypothesis is, which is an educated guess about a parameter. Once you have the hypothesis, you collect data and use the data to make a determination to see if there is enough evidence to show that the hypothesis is true. However, in hypothesis testing you actually assume something else is true, and then you look at your data to see how likely it is to get an event that your data demonstrates with that assumption. If the event is very unusual, then you might think that your assumption is actually false. If you are able to say this assumption is false, then your hypothesis must be true. This is known as a proof by contradiction. You assume the opposite of your hypothesis is true and show that it can't be true. If this happens, then your hypothesis must be true. All hypothesis tests go through the same process. Once you have the process down, then the concept is much easier. It is easier to see the process by looking at an example. Concepts that are needed will be detailed in this example.

**Example \#7.1.1: Basics of Hypothesis Testing**

> Suppose a manufacturer of the XJ35 battery claims the mean life of the battery is 500 days with a standard deviation of 25 days. You are the buyer of this battery and you think this claim is inflated. You would like to test your belief because without a good reason you can't get out of your contract.

If you did, you wouldn't be doing any testing. The true mean, , is unknown. That means you should define that too.

> You have a guess that the mean life of a battery is less than 500 days. This is opposed to what the manufacturer claims. There really are two hypotheses, which are just guesses here -- the one that the manufacturer claims and the one that you believe. It is helpful to have names for them.

**Null Hypothesis**: historical value, claim, or product specification. The symbol used is [MISSING] .

**Alternate Hypothesis:** what you want to prove. This is what you want to accept as true when you reject the null hypothesis. There are two symbols that are commonly used for the alternative hypothesis: or [MISSING]. The symbol will be used in this book. 

In general, the hypotheses look something like this:

[MISSING EQ]

where just represents the value that the claim says the population mean is actually equal to.

Also, can be less than, greater than, or not equal to.

For this problem:

> , since the manufacturer says the mean life of a battery is 500 days.
>
> , since you believe that the mean life of the battery is less than 500 days.

Now back to the mean. You have a sample mean of 490 days. Is this small enough to believe that you are right and the manufacturer is wrong? How small does it have to be?

If you calculated a sample mean of 235, you would definitely believe the population mean is less than 500. But even if you had a sample mean of 435 you would probably believe that the true mean was less than 500. What about 475? Or 483? There is some point where you would stop being so sure that the population mean is less than 500. That point separates the values of where you are sure or pretty sure that the mean is less than 500 from the area where you are not so sure. How do you find that point?

Well it depends on how much error you want to make. Of course you don't want to make any errors, but unfortunately that is unavoidable in statistics. You need to figure out how much error you made with your sample. Take the sample mean, and find the probability of getting another sample mean less than it, assuming for the moment that the manufacturer is right. The idea behind this is that you want to know what is the chance that you could have come up with your sample mean even if the population mean really is 500 days.

> You want to find

To compute this probability, you need to know how the sample mean is distributed. Since the sample size is at least 30, then you know the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Remember and

A picture is always useful.

> [\[CHART\]]{.chart}

Before calculating the probability, it is useful to see how many standard deviations away from the mean the sample mean is. Using the formula for the *z*-score from chapter 6, you find

This sample mean is more than two standard deviations away from the mean. That seems pretty far, but you should look at the probability too.

> On TI-83/84:
>
> On R:

There is a 1.42% chance that you could find a sample mean less than 490 when the population mean is 500 days. This is really small, so the chances are that the assumption that the population mean is 500 days is wrong, and you can reject the manufacturer's claim. But how do you quantify really small? Is 5% or 10% or 15% really small? How do you decide?

Before you answer that question, a couple more definitions are needed.

**Test statistic:** since it is calculated as part of the testing of the hypothesis

**p -- value:** probability that the test statistic will take on more extreme values than the observed test statistic, given that the null hypothesis is true. It is the probability that was calculated above.

Now, how small is small enough? To answer that, you really want to know the types of errors you can make.

There are actually only two errors that can be made. The first error is if you say that is false, when in fact it is true. This means you reject when was true. The second error is if you say that is true, when in fact it is false. This means you fail to reject when is false. The following table organizes this for you:

Type of errors:

                   true           false
  ---------------- -------------- ---------------
  Reject           Type I error   No error
  Fail to reject   No error       Type II error

Thus

**Type I Error** is rejecting when is true, and

**Type II Error** is failing to reject when is false.

Since these are the errors, then one can define the probabilities
attached to each error.

= P(type I error) = P(rejecting / is true)

= P(type II error) = P(failing to reject / is false)

is also called the **level of significance**.

Another common concept that is used is Power =  [MISSING].

Now there is a relationship between and . They are not complements of each other. How are they related?

If increases that means the chances of making a type I error will increase. It is more likely that a type I error will occur. It makes sense that you are less likely to make type II errors, only because you will be rejecting more often. You will be failing to reject less, and therefore, the chance of making a type II error will decrease. Thus, as increases, will decrease, and vice versa. That makes them seem like complements, but they aren't complements. What gives? Consider one more factor -- sample size.

Consider if you have a larger sample that is representative of the population, then it makes sense that you have more accuracy then with a smaller sample. Think of it this way, which would you trust more, a sample mean of 490 if you had a sample size of 35 or sample size of 350 (assuming a representative sample)? Of course the 350 because there are more data points and so more accuracy. If you are more accurate, then there is less chance that you will make any error. By increasing the sample size of a representative sample, you decrease both and .

Summary of all of this:

1.  For a certain sample size, *n*, if increases, decreases.

2.  For a certain level of significance, , if *n* increases, decreases.

Now how do you find and ? Well is actually chosen. There are only three values that are usually picked for : 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10. is very difficult to find, so usually it isn't found. If you want to make sure it is small you take as large of a sample as you can afford provided it is a representative sample. This is one use of the Power. You want to be small and the Power of the test is large. The Power word sounds good.

Which pick of do you pick? Well that depends on what you are working on. Remember in this example you are the buyer who is trying to get out of a contract to buy these batteries. If you create a type I error, you said that the batteries are bad when they aren't, most likely the manufacturer will sue you. You want to avoid this. You might pick to be 0.01. This way you have a small chance of making a type I error. Of course this means you have more of a chance of making a type II error. No big deal right? What if the batteries are used in pacemakers and you tell the person that their pacemaker's batteries are good for 500 days when they actually last less, that might be bad. If you make a type II error, you say that the batteries do last 500 days when they last less, then you have the possibility of killing someone. You certainly do not want to do this. In this case you might want to pick as 0.10. If both errors are equally bad, then pick as 0.05.

The above discussion is why the choice of depends on what you are researching. As the researcher, you are the one that needs to decide what level to use based on your analysis of the consequences of making each error is.

If a type I error is really bad, then pick = 0.01.

If a type II error is really bad, then pick = 0.10

If neither error is bad, or both are equally bad, then pick = 0.05

The main thing is to always pick the before you collect the data and start the test.

The above discussion was long, but it is really important information. If you don't know what the errors of the test are about, then there really is no point in making conclusions with the tests. Make sure you understand what the two errors are and what the probabilities are for them.

Now it is time to go back to the example and put this all together. This is the basic structure of testing a hypothesis, usually called a hypothesis test. Since this one has a test statistic involving *z*, it is also called a *z*-test. And since there is only one sample, it is usually called a one-sample *z*-test.

**Example \#7.1.2: Battery Example Revisited. **

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words

2.  State the null and alternative hypothesis and the level of

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

    Every hypothesis has some assumptions that be met to make sure that
    the results of the hypothesis are valid. The assumptions are
    different for each test. This test has the following assumptions.

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of size *n* is taken.

    This occurred in this example, since it was stated that a random
    sample of 30 battery lives were taken.

b.  The population standard deviation is known.

    This is true, since it was given in the problem.

c.  The sample size is at least 30 or the population of the random
    variable is normally distributed.

    The sample size was 30, so this condition is met.

In fact, in general:

Reject if the p-value \< and

That's it. That is what a hypothesis test looks like. All hypothesis
tests are done with the same six steps. Those general six steps are
outlined below.

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words. This is where
    you are defining what the unknowns are in this problem.

> x = random variable
>
> = mean of random variable, if the parameter of interest is the mean.
> There are other parameters you can test, and you would use the
> appropriate symbol for that parameter.

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of
    significance

> , where is the known mean
>
> , use the appropriate one for your problem
>
> Also, state your level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

    Each hypothesis test has its own assumptions. They will be stated
    when the different hypothesis tests are discussed.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

5.  Conclusion

6.  Interpretation

> show is true.

Sorry, one more concept about the conclusion and interpretation. First,
the conclusion is that you reject or you fail to reject . Why was it
said like this? It is because you never **accept** the null hypothesis.
If you wanted to accept the null hypothesis, then why do the test in the
first place? In the interpretation, you either have enough evidence to
show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true. You
wouldn't want to go to all this work and then find out you wanted to
accept the claim. Why go through the trouble? You always want to show
that the alternative hypothesis is true. Sometimes you can do that and
sometimes you can't. It doesn't mean you proved the null hypothesis; it
just means you can't prove the alternative hypothesis. Here is an
example to demonstrate this.

**Example \#7.1.3: Conclusions in Hypothesis Tests**

The same is true in a hypothesis test. There is either enough or not
enough evidence to show that alternative hypothesis. It is not that you
proved the null hypothesis true.

When identifying hypothesis, it is important to state your random
variable and the appropriate parameter you want to make a decision
about. If count something, then the random variable is the number of
whatever you counted. The parameter is the proportion of what you
counted. If the random variable is something you measured, then the
parameter is the mean of what you measured. (Note: there are other
parameters you can calculate, and some analysis of those will be
presented in later chapters.)

**Example \#7.1.4: Stating Hypotheses**

> Identify the hypotheses necessary to test the following statements:

a.  The average salary of a teacher is more than \$30,000.

> **Solution:**

> The guess is that and that is the alternative hypothesis.

b.  The proportion of students who like math is less than 10%.

> **Solution:**

> **Solution:**
>
> *x* = age of students in this class

    deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing
    the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the
    number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The
    sample mean is 92.3 days. The corporation wants to know if the mean
    number of days is more than the 90 days claimed. State the type I
    and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each
    error, and state which level of significance to use.

Hint -- hypothesis testing is really easy if you follow the same recipe
every time. The only differences in the various problems are the
assumptions of the test and the test statistic you calculate so you can
find the p-value. Do the same steps, in the same order, with the same
words, every time and these problems become very easy.

## One-Sample Proportion Test

There are many different parameters that you can test. There is a test for the mean, such as was introduced with the z-test. There is also a test for the population proportion, *p*. This is where you might be curious if the proportion of students who smoke at your school is lower than the proportion in your area. Or you could question if the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers' education class is more than the national proportion.

To test a population proportion, there are a few things that need to be defined first. Usually, Greek letters are used for parameters and Latin letters for statistics. When talking about proportions, it makes sense to use *p* for proportion. The Greek letter for *p* is , but that is too confusing to use. Instead, it is best to use *p* for the population proportion. That means that a different symbol is needed for the sample proportion. The convention is to use, , known as p-hat. This way you know that *p* is the population proportion, and that is the sample proportion related to it.

Now proportion tests are about looking for the percentage of individuals who have a particular attribute. You are really looking for the number of successes that happen. Thus, a proportion test involves a binomial distribution.

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners was taken.
    However, the sample was not a random sample, since it was data from
    six years. It is the numbers for all prisoners in these six years,
    but the six years were not picked at random. Unless there was
    something special about the six years that were chosen, the sample
    is probably a representative sample. This assumption is probably
    met.

b.  There are 14,495 prisoners in this case. The prisoners are all
    Aboriginals, so you are not mixing Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal
    prisoners. There are only two outcomes, either the prisoner dies or
    doesn't. The chance that one prisoner dies over another may not be
    constant, but if you consider all prisoners the same, then it may be
    close to the same probability. Thus the conditions for the binomial
    distribution are satisfied

c.  In this case *p* = 0.0027 and *n* = 14,495. and . So, the sampling
    distribution for is a normal distribution.

a.  A simple random sample of 500 breastfeeding habits of woman in a

b.  There were 500 women in the study. The women are considered
    identical, though they probably have some differences. There are
    only two outcomes, either the woman breastfeeds or she doesn't. The
    probability of a woman breastfeeding is probably not the same for
    each woman, but it is probably not very different for each woman.

Notice, the conclusion is that there wasn\'t enough evidence to show
what said. The conclusion was not that you proved true. There are many
reasons why you can't say that is true. It could be that the countries
you chose were not very representative of what truly happens. If you
instead looked at all high-income countries and compared them to
low-income countries, you might have different results. It could also be
that the sample you collected in the low-income country was not
representative. It could also be that income level is not an indication
of breastfeeding habits. There could be other factors involved. This is
why you can't say that you have proven is true. There are too many other
factors that could be the reason that you failed to reject .

### Homework

**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the
assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be
correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.**

1.  Eyeglassomatic manufactures eyeglasses for different retailers. They
    test to see how many defective lenses they made in a given time
    period and found that 11% of all lenses had defects of some type.
    Looking at the type of defects, they found in a three-month time
    period that out of 34,641 defective lenses, 5865 were due to
    scratches. Are there more defects from scratches than from all other
    causes? Use a 1% level of significance.

2.  In July of 1997, Australians were asked if they thought unemployment
    would increase, and 47% thought that it would increase. In November
    of 1997, they were asked again. At that time 284 out of 631 said
    that they thought unemployment would increase (\"Morgan gallup
    poll,\" 2013). At the 5% level, is there enough evidence to show
    that the proportion of Australians in November 1997 who believe
    unemployment would increase is less than the proportion who felt it
    would increase in July 1997?

3.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on
    consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007
    were for identity theft. In that year, Arkansas had 1,601 complaints
    of identity theft out of 3,482 consumer complaints (\"Consumer fraud
    and,\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that
    Arkansas had a higher proportion of identity theft than 23%? Test at
    the 5% level.

4.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on
    consumer fraud and identity theft, 23% of all complaints in 2007
    were for identity theft. In that year, Alaska had 321 complaints of
    identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\"Consumer fraud
    and,\" 2008). Does this data provide enough evidence to show that
    Alaska had a lower proportion of identity theft than 23%? Test at
    the 5% level.

5.  In 2001, the Gallup poll found that 81% of American adults believed
    that there was a conspiracy in the death of President Kennedy. In
    2013, the Gallup poll asked 1,039 American adults if they believe
    there was a conspiracy in the assassination, and found that 634
    believe there was a conspiracy (\"Gallup news service,\" 2013). Do
    the data show that the proportion of Americans who believe in this
    conspiracy has decreased? Test at the 1% level.

6.  In 2008, there were 507 children in Arizona out of 32,601 who were
    diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (\"Autism and
    developmental,\" 2008). Nationally 1 in 88 children are diagnosed
    with ASD (\"CDC features -,\" 2013). Is there sufficient data to
    show that the incident of ASD is more in Arizona than nationally?
    Test at the 1% level.

## One-Sample Test for the Mean

It is time to go back to look at the test for the mean that was
introduced in section 7.1 called the z-test. In the example, you knew
what the population standard deviation, , was. What if you don't know ?

You could just use the sample standard deviation, *s*, as an
approximation of. That means the test statistic is now . Great, now you
can go and find the p-value using the normal curve. Or can you? Is this
new test statistic normally distributed? Actually, it is not. How is it
distributed? A man named W. S. Gossett figured out what this
distribution is and called it the Student's t-distribution. There are
some assumptions that must be made for this formula to be a Student's
t-distribution. These are outlined in the following theorem. Note: the
t-distribution is called the Student's t-distribution because that is
the name he published under because he couldn't publish under his own
name due to employer not wanting him to publish under his own name. His
employer by the way was Guinness and they didn\'t want competitors
knowing they had a chemist working for them. It is not called the
Student's t-distribution because it is only used by students.

Theorem: If the following assumptions are met

a.  A random sample of size *n* is taken.

b.  The distribution of the random variable is normal or the sample size
    is 30 or more.

> Then the distribution of is a Student's t-distribution with degrees of
> freedom.

**Explanation of degrees of freedom:** Recall the formula for sample
standard deviation is . Notice the denominator is . This is the same as
the degrees of freedom. This is no accident. The reason the denominator
and the degrees of freedom are both comes from how the standard
deviation is calculated. Remember, first you take each data value and
subtract . If you add up all of these new values, you will get 0. This
must happen. Since it must happen, the first data values you have
"freedom of choice", but the nth data value, you have no freedom to
choose. Hence, you have degrees of freedom. Another way to think about
it is that if you five people and five chairs, the first four people
have a choice of where they are sitting, but the last person does not.
They have no freedom of where to sit. Only people have freedom of
choice.

The Student's t-distribution is a bell-shape that is more spread out
than the normal distribution. There are many t-distributions, one for
each different degree of freedom.

Here is a graph of the normal distribution and the Student's
t-distribution for df = 1 and df = 2.

**Figure \#7.3.1: Typical Student t-Distributions**

> ![](media/image196.png){width="3.763888888888889in"
> height="2.2083333333333335in"}

As the degrees of freedom increases, the student's t-distribution looks
more like the normal distribution.

To find probabilities for the t-distribution, again technology can do
this for you. There are many technologies out there that you can use.

On the TI-83/84, the command is in the DISTR menu and is tcdf(. The
syntax for this command is

On R: the command to find the area to the left of a t value is pt(t
value, df)

    size is large. This means that if this condition isn't met, but your
    sample size is quite large (over 30), then the results of the t-test
    are valid.

c.  The population standard deviation, , is unknown.

6.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the
> test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have
> enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to
> show is true.

**How to check the assumptions of t-test:**

In order for the t-test to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be
true. Whenever you run a t-test, you must make sure the assumptions are
true. You need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the condition that the sample is a random sample, describe how
    you took the sample. Make sure your sampling technique is random.

2.  For the condition that population of the random variable is normal,
    remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6.

Note: if the assumptions behind this test are not valid, then the
conclusions you make from the test are not valid. If you do not have a
random sample, that is your fault. Make sure the sample you take is as
random as you can make it following sampling techniques from chapter 1.
If the population of the random variable is not normal, then take a
sample larger than 30. If you cannot afford to do that, or if it is not
logistically possible, then you do different tests called non-parametric
tests. There is an entire course on non-parametric tests, and they will
not be discussed in this book.

a.  A random sample of 53 life expectancies of European men in 2011 was
    taken. The data is actually all of the life expectancies for every
    country that is considered part of Europe by the World Health
    Organization. However, the information is still sample information
    since it is only for one year that the data was collected. It may
    not be a random sample, but that is probably not an issue in this
    case.

b.  The distribution of life expectancies of European men in 2011 is
    normally distributed. To see if this condition has been met, look at
    the histogram, number of outliers, and the normal probability plot.

### Homework

**In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the
assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be
correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.**

1.  The Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997, and required countries to
    start reducing their carbon emissions. The protocol became
    enforceable in February 2005. In 2004, the mean CO~2~ emission was
    4.87 metric tons per capita. Table 7.3.3 contains a random sample of
    CO~2~ emissions in 2010 (\"CO2 emissions,\" 2013). Is there enough
    evidence to show that the mean CO~2~ emission is lower in 2010 than
    in 2004? Test at the 1% level.

2.  The amount of sugar in a Krispy Kream glazed donut is 10 g. Many
    people feel that cereal is a healthier alternative for children over
    glazed donuts. Table \#7.3.4 contains the amount of sugar in a
    sample of cereal that is geared towards children (\"Healthy

3.  The FDA regulates that fish that is consumed is allowed to contain
    1.0 mg/kg of mercury. In Florida, bass fish were collected in 53
    different lakes to measure the amount of mercury in the fish. The
    data for the average amount of mercury in each lake is in table
    \#7.3.5 (\"Multi-disciplinary niser activity,\" 2013). Do the data
    provide enough evidence to show that the fish in Florida lakes has
    more mercury than the allowable amount? Test at the 10% level.

4.  Stephen Stigler determined in 1977 that the speed of light is
    299,710.5 km/sec. In 1882, Albert Michelson had collected
    measurements on the speed of light (\"Student t-distribution,\"
    2013). His measurements are given in table \#7.3.6. Is there
    evidence to show that Michelson's data is different from Stigler's
    value of the speed of light? Test at the 5% level.

5.  Table \#7.3.7 contains pulse rates after running for 1 minute,
    collected from females who drink alcohol (\"Pulse rates before,\"
    2013). The mean pulse rate after running for 1 minute of females who
    do not drink is 97 beats per minute. Do the data show that the mean
    pulse rate of females who do drink alcohol is higher than the mean
    pulse rate of females who do not drink? Test at the 5% level.

6.  The economic dynamism, which is the index of productive growth in
    dollars for countries that are designated by the World Bank as
    middle-income are in table \#7.3.8 (\"SOCR data 2008,\" 2013).
    Countries that are considered high-income have a mean economic
    dynamism of 60.29. Do the data show that the mean economic dynamism
    of middle-income countries is less than the mean for high-income
    countries? Test at the 5% level.

7.  In 1999, the average percentage of women who received prenatal care
    per country is 80.1%. Table \#7.3.9 contains the percentage of woman
    receiving prenatal care in 2009 for a sample of countries
    (\"Pregnant woman receiving,\" 2013). Do the data show that the
    average percentage of women receiving prenatal care in 2009 is
    higher than in 1999? Test at the 5% level.

8.  Maintaining your balance may get harder as you grow older. A study
    was conducted to see how steady the elderly is on their feet. They
    had the subjects stand on a force platform and have them react to a
    noise. The force platform then measured how much they swayed forward
    and backward, and the data is in table \#7.3.10 (\"Maintaining
    balance while,\" 2013). Do the data show that the elderly sway more
    than the mean forward sway of younger people, which is 18.125 mm?
    Test at the 5% level.
