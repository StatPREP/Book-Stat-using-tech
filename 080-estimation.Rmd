# Estimation

In hypothesis tests, the purpose was to make a decision about a parameter, in terms of it being greater than, less than, or not equal to a value. But what if you want to actually know what the parameter is. You need to do estimation. There are two types of estimation -- point estimator and confidence interval.

## Basics of Confidence Intervals

A point estimator is just the statistic that you have calculated previously. As an example, when you wanted to estimate the population mean, [MISSING] , the point estimator is the sample mean, [MISSING]. To estimate the population proportion, *p*, you use the sample proportion, [MISSING]. In general, if you want to estimate any population parameter, we will call it  [MISSING], you use the sample statistic, [MISSING].

Point estimators are really easy to find, but they have some drawbacks. First, if you have a large sample size, then the estimate is better. But with a point estimator, you don't know what the sample size is. Also, you don't know how accurate the estimate is. Both of these problems are solved with a confidence interval.

**Confidence interval:** This is where you have an interval surrounding your parameter, and the interval has a chance of being a true statement. In general, a confidence interval looks like: , where is the point estimator and *E* is the margin of error term that is added and subtracted from the point estimator. Thus making an interval.

**Interpreting a confidence interval: **

The statistical interpretation is that the confidence interval has a probability (, where is the complement of the confidence level) of containing the population parameter. As an example, if you have a 95% confidence interval of 0.65 \< *p* \< 0.73, then you would say, "there is a 95% chance that the interval 0.65 to 0.73 contains the true population proportion." This means that if you have 100 intervals, 95 of them will contain the true proportion, and 5% will not. The wrong interpretation is that there is a 95% chance that the true value of *p* will fall between 0.65 and 0.73. The reason that this interpretation is wrong is that the true value is fixed out there somewhere. You are trying to capture it with this interval. So this is the chance is that your interval captures it, and not that the true value falls in the interval.

There is also a real world interpretation that depends on the situation. It is where you are telling people what numbers you found the parameter to lie between. So your real world is where you tell what values your parameter is between. There is no probability attached to this statement. That probability is in the statistical interpretation.

The common probabilities used for confidence intervals are 90%, 95%, and 99%. These are known as the confidence level. The confidence level and the alpha level are related. For a two-tailed test, the confidence level is . This is because the is both tails and the confidence level is area between the two tails. As an example, for a two-tailed test (H~A~ is not equal to) with equal to 0.10, the confidence level would be 0.90 or 90%. If you have a one-tailed test, then your is only one tail. Because of symmetry the other tail is also . So you have 2 with both tails. So the confidence level, which is the area between the two tails, is [MISSING].

**Example \#8.1.1: Stating the Statistical and Real World
Interpretations for a Confidence Interval**

a\. Suppose you have a 95% confidence interval for the mean age a woman
gets married in 2013 is . State the statistical and real world
interpretations of this statement.

**Solution:**

> Statistical Interpretation: There is a 95% chance that the interval
> contains the mean age a woman gets married in 2013.
>
> Real World Interpretation: The mean age that a woman married in 2013
> is between 26 and 28 years of age.

b\. Suppose a 99% confidence interval for the proportion of Americans who
have tried marijuana as of 2013 is . State the statistical and real
world interpretations of this statement.

**Solution:**

> Statistical Interpretation: There is a 99% chance that the interval
> contains the proportion of Americans who have tried marijuana as of
> 2013.
>
> Real World Interpretation: The proportion of Americans who have tried
> marijuana as of 2013 is between 0.35 and 0.41.

One last thing to know about confidence is how the sample size and
confidence level affect how wide the interval is. The following
discussion demonstrates what happens to the width of the interval as you
get more confident.

Think about shooting an arrow into the target. Suppose you are really
good at that and that you have a 90% chance of hitting the bull's eye.
Now the bull's eye is very small. Since you hit the bull's eye
approximately 90% of the time, then you probably hit inside the next
ring out 95% of the time. You have a better chance of doing this, but
the circle is bigger. You probably have a 99% chance of hitting the
target, but that is a much bigger circle to hit. You can see, as your
confidence in hitting the target increases, the circle you hit gets
bigger. The same is true for confidence intervals. This is demonstrated
in figure \#8.1.1.

**Figure \#8.1.1: Affect of Confidence Level on Width**

> ![](media/image21.png){width="3.5in" height="1.3055555555555556in"}

The higher level of confidence makes a wider interval. There's a trade
off between width and confidence level. You can be really confident
about your answer but your answer will not be very precise. Or you can
have a precise answer (small margin of error) but not be very confident
about your answer.

Now look at how the sample size affects the size of the interval.
Suppose figure \#8.1.2 represents confidence intervals calculated on a
95% interval. A larger sample size from a representative sample makes
the width of the interval narrower. This makes sense. Large samples are
closer to the true population so the point estimate is pretty close to
the true value.

**Figure \#8.1.2: Affect of Sample Size on Width**

> ![](media/image22.png){width="3.2916666666666665in"
> height="1.3055555555555556in"}

Now you know everything you need to know about confidence intervals
except for the actual formula. The formula depends on which parameter
you are trying to estimate. With different situations you will be given
the confidence interval for that parameter.

## One-Sample Interval for the Proportion

Suppose you want to estimate the population proportion, *p*. As an example you may be curious what proportion of students at your school smoke. Or you could wonder what is the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers' education class. 
**Confidence Interval for One Population Proportion (1-Prop Interval)**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

> *x* = number of successes
>
> *p* = proportion of successes

2.  State and check the assumptions for confidence interval

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of size *n* is taken.

b.  The condition for the binomial distribution are satisfied

c.  To determine the sampling distribution of , you need to show that
    and , where . If this requirement is true, then the sampling
    distribution of is well approximated by a normal curve. (In reality
    this is not really true, since the correct assumption deals with
    *p*. However, in a confidence interval you do not know *p*, so you
    must use . This means you just need to show that and .)

<!-- -->

3.  Find the sample statistic and the confidence interval

> Sample Proportion:
>
> Confidence Interval:
>
> Where
>
> *p* = population proportion
>
> = sample proportion
>
> *n* = number of sample values
>
> *E* = margin of error
>
> = critical value

4.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "there is a
    C% chance that contains the true proportion."

5.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval
    contains the true proportion.

The critical value is a value from the normal distribution. Since a
confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error
amount from the sample proportion, and the interval has a probability of
containing the true proportion, then you can think of this as the
statement . You can use the invNorm command on the TI-83/84 calculator
or qnorm command on R to find the critical value. The critical values
will always be the same value, so it is easier to just look at table A.1
in the appendix.

**Example \#8.2.1: Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion
Using the Formula**

> A concern was raised in Australia that the percentage of deaths of
> Aboriginal prisoners was higher than the percent of deaths of
> non-Aboriginal prisoners, which is 0.27%. A sample of six years
> (1990-1995) of data was collected, and it was found that out of 14,495

> died.
>
> **Solution:**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

> *x* = number of Aboriginal prisoners who die
>
> *p* = proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who die

2.  State and check the assumptions for a confidence interval

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of 14,495 Aboriginal prisoners was taken.
    However, the sample was not a random sample, since it was data from
    six years. It is the numbers for all prisoners in these six years,
    but the six years were not picked at random. Unless there was
    something special about the six years that were chosen, the sample
    is probably a representative sample. This assumption is probably
    met.

b.  There are 14,495 prisoners in this case. The prisoners are all
    Aboriginals, so you are not mixing Aboriginal with non-Aboriginal
    prisoners. There are only two outcomes, either the prisoner dies or
    doesn't. The chance that one prisoner dies over another may not be
    constant, but if you consider all prisoners the same, then it may be
    close to the same probability. Thus the assumptions for the binomial
    distribution are satisfied

c.  In this case, and and both are greater than or equal to 5. The
    sampling distribution for is a normal distribution.

3.  Find the sample statistic and the confidence interval

> Sample Proportion:
>
> Confidence Interval:
>
> , since 95% confidence level

4.  Statistical Interpretation: There is a 95% chance that contains the
    proportion of Aboriginal prisoners who died.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of Aboriginal prisoners
    who died is between 0.0026 and 0.0045.

You can also do the calculations for the confidence interval with
technology. The following example shows the process on the TI-83/84.

**Example \#8.2.2: Confidence Interval for the Population Proportion
Using Technology**

> A researcher studying the effects of income levels on breastfeeding of
> infants hypothesizes that countries where the income level is lower
> have a higher rate of infant breastfeeding than higher income
> countries. It is known that in Germany, considered a high-income
> country by the World Bank, 22% of all babies are breastfeed. In

> researchers found that in a random sample of 500 new mothers that 125
> were breastfeeding their infants. Find a 90% confidence interval of
> the proportion of mothers in low-income countries who breastfeed their
> infants?
>
> **Solution:**

1.  State you random variable and the parameter in words.

> *x* = number of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country
>
> *p* = proportion of woman who breastfeed in a low-income country

2.  State and check the assumptions for a confidence interval

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of 500 breastfeeding habits of woman in a     low-income country was taken as was stated in the problem.

b.  There were 500 women in the study. The women are considered     identical, though they probably have some differences. There are     only two outcomes, either the woman breastfeeds or she doesn't. The     probability of a woman breastfeeding is probably not the same for     each woman, but it is probably not very different for each woman.     The assumptions for the binomial distribution are satisfied

c.  and and both are greater than or equal to 5, so the sampling     distribution of is well approximated by a normal curve.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: There is a 90% chance that contains the     proportion of women in low-income countries who breastfeed their     infants.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The proportion of women in low-income     countries who breastfeed their infants is between 0.219 and 0.284.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the confidence interval. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the confidence interval.

1.  Eyeglassomatic manufactures eyeglasses for different retailers. They     test to see how many defective lenses they make. Looking at the type     of defects, they found in a three-month time period that out of     34,641 defective lenses, 5865 were due to scratches. Find a 99%     confidence interval for the proportion of defects that are from     scratches.

2.  In November of 1997, Australians were asked if they thought     unemployment would increase. At that time 284 out of 631 said that     they thought unemployment would increase (\"Morgan gallup poll,\"     2013). Estimate the proportion of Australians in November 1997 who     believed unemployment would increase using a 95% confidence     interval?

3.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on     consumer fraud and identity theft, Arkansas had 1,601 complaints of     identity theft out of 3,482 consumer complaints (\"Consumer fraud     and,\" 2008). Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion     of identity theft in Arkansas.

4.  According to the February 2008 Federal Trade Commission report on     consumer fraud and identity theft, Alaska had 321 complaints of     identity theft out of 1,432 consumer complaints (\"Consumer fraud     and,\" 2008). Calculate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion     of identity theft in Alaska.

5.  In 2013, the Gallup poll asked 1,039 American adults if they believe     there was a conspiracy in the assassination of President Kennedy,     and found that 634 believe there was a conspiracy (\"Gallup news     service,\" 2013). Estimate the proportion of American's who believe     in this conspiracy using a 98% confidence interval.

6.  In 2008, there were 507 children in Arizona out of 32,601 who were     diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (\"Autism and     developmental,\" 2008). Find the proportion of ASD in Arizona with a     confidence level of 99%.

## One-Sample Interval for the Mean

Suppose you want to estimate the mean height of Americans, or you want to estimate the mean salary of college graduates. A confidence interval for the mean would be the way to estimate these means.

**Confidence Interval for One Population Mean (t-Interval)**

1.  State the random variable and the parameter in words.

> x = random variable
>
> = mean of random variable

2.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of size *n* is taken.

b.  The population of the random variable is normally distributed,     though the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the sample     size is large. This means that if this assumption isn't met, but     your sample size is quite large (over 30), then the results of the     t-test are valid.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

> where
>
> is the point estimator for
>
> is the critical value where degrees of freedom:
>
> *s* is the sample standard deviation
>
> *n* is the sample size

 4.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "there is a     C% chance that the statement contains the true mean."

5.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval     contains the true mean. 
The critical value is a value from the Student's t-distribution. Since a
confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error
amount from the sample mean, and the interval has a probability of
containing the true mean, then you can think of this as the statement .
The critical values are found in table A.2 in the appendix

**How to check the assumptions of confidence interval:**

In order for the confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the
test must be true. Whenever you run a confidence interval, you must make
sure the assumptions are true. You need to check them. Here is how you
do this:

1.  For the assumption that the sample is a random sample, describe how
    you took the sample. Make sure your sampling technique is random.

2.  For the assumption that population is normal, remember the process
    of assessing normality from chapter 6.

**Solution:**

> *x* = life expectancy for a European man in 2011
>
> = mean life expectancy for European men in 2011

2.  State and check the assumptions for a confidence interval

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of 53 life expectancies of European men in 2011 was
    taken. The data is actually all of the life expectancies for every
    country that is considered part of Europe by the World Health
    Organization. However, the information is still sample information
    since it is only for one year that the data was collected. It may
    not be a random sample, but that is probably not an issue in this
    case.

b.  The distribution of life expectancies of European men in 2011 is
    normally distributed. To see if this assumption has been met, look
    at the histogram, number of outliers, and the normal probability
    plot. (If you wish, you can look at the normal probability plot
    first. If it doesn't look linear, then you may want to look at the
    histogram and number of outliers at this point.)

This population does not appear to be normally distributed. The t-test
is robust for sample sizes larger than 30 so you can go ahead and
calculate the interval.
