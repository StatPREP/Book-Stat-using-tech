# Two-Sample Inference

Chapter 7 discussed methods of hypothesis testing about one-population parameters. Chapter 8 discussed methods of estimating population parameters from one sample using confidence intervals. This chapter will look at methods of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for two populations. Since there are two populations, there are two random variables, two means or proportions, and two samples (though with paired samples you usually consider there to be one sample with pairs collected). Examples of where you would do this are:

> Testing and estimating the difference in testosterone levels of men
> before and after they had children (Gettler, McDade, Feranil & Kuzawa,
> 2011).
>
> Testing the claim that a diet works by looking at the weight before
> and after subjects are on the diet.
>
> Estimating the difference in proportion of those who approve of
> President Obama in the age group 18 to 26 year olds and the 55 and
> over age group.

All of these are examples of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for two populations. The methods to conduct these hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be explored in this method. As a reminder, all hypothesis tests are the same process. The only thing that changes is the formula that you use. Confidence intervals are also the same process, except that the formula is different.

## Two Proportions

There are times you want to test a claim about two population
proportions or construct a confidence interval estimate of the
difference between two population proportions. As with all other
hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same
though the formulas and assumptions are different.

**Hypothesis Test for Two Population Proportion (2-Prop Test)**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

> = number of successes from group 1
>
> = number of successes from group 2
>
> = proportion of successes in group 1
>
> = proportion of successes in group 2

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of
    significance

> or
>
> Also, state your level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of size is taken from population 1, and a
    simple random sample of size is taken from population 2.

b.  The samples are independent.

c.  The assumptions for the binomial distribution are satisfied for both
    populations.

d.  To determine the sampling distribution of , you need to show that
    and , where . If this requirement is true, then the sampling
    distribution of is well approximated by a normal curve. To determine
    the sampling distribution of , you need to show that and , where .
    If this requirement is true, then the sampling distribution of is
    well approximated by a normal curve. However, you do not know and ,
    so you need to use and instead. This is not perfect, but it is the
    best you can do. Since (and similar for the other calculations) you
    just need to make sure that , , ,and are all more than 5.

**Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population
Proportion (2-Prop Interval)**

The confidence interval for the difference in proportions has the same
random variables and proportions and the same assumptions as the
hypothesis test for two proportions. If you have already completed the
hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you
haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables
and proportions and state and check the assumptions before completing
the confidence interval step.

1.  Find the sample statistics and the confidence interval

> Sample Proportion:
>
> Confidence Interval:
>
> The confidence interval estimate of the difference is
>
> where the margin of error E is given by
>
> = critical value

2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "there is a
    C% chance that contains the true difference in proportions."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state how much more (or
    less) the first proportion is from the second proportion.

The critical value is a value from the normal distribution. Since a
confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error
amount from the sample proportion, and the interval has a probability of
being true, then you can think of this as the statement . So you can use
the invNorm command on the TI-83/84 calculator or qnorm on R to find the
critical value. These are always the same value, so it is easier to just
look at the table A.1 in the Appendix.

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of
    significance

3.  State and check the assumptions for a hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A simple random sample of 1000 responses about cheating from
    husbands is taken. This was stated in the problem. A simple random
    sample of 1200 responses about cheating from wives is taken. This
    was stated in the problem.

b.  The samples are independent. This is true since the samples involved
    different genders.

c.  The properties of the binomial distribution are satisfied in both
    populations. This is true since there are only two responses, there
    are a fixed number of trials, the probability of a success is the
    same, and the trials are independent.

d.  The sampling distributions of and can be approximated with a normal
    distribution.

    , , , and are all greater than or equal to 5. So both sampling
    distributions of and can be approximated with a normal distribution.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test or interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.

## Paired Samples for Two Means

Are two populations the same? Is the average height of men taller than the average height of women? Is the mean weight less after a diet than before?

You can compare populations by comparing their means. You take a sample from each population and compare the statistics.

Anytime you compare two populations you need to know if the samples are independent or dependent. The formulas you use are different for different types of samples.

If how you choose one sample has no effect on the way you choose the other sample, the two samples are **independent.** The way to think about it is that in independent samples, the individuals from one sample are overall different from the individuals from the other sample. This will mean that sample one has no affect on sample two. The sample values from one sample are not related or paired with values from the other sample.

If you choose the samples so that a measurement in one sample is paired with a measurement from the other sample, the samples are **dependent** or **matched** or **paired**. (Often a before and after situation.) You want to make sure the there is a meaning for pairing data values from one sample with a specific data value from the other sample. One way to think about it is that in dependent samples, the individuals from one sample are the same individuals from the other sample, though there can be other reasons to pair values. This makes the sample values from each sample paired.

**Example \#9.2.1: Independent or Dependent Samples**

> Determine if the following are dependent or independent samples.

a.  Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights

> **Solution:**
>
> Independent, since there is no reason that one value belongs to another. The individuals are not the same for both samples. The individuals are definitely different. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a man is chosen in one sample does not give any information about any of the woman chosen in the other sample.

b.  Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new wonder diet drug and later weigh them again.

> **Solution:**
>
> Dependent, since each person's before weight can be matched with their after weight. The individuals are the same for both samples. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a person weighs 400 pounds at the beginning will tell you something about their weight after the diet drug.

c.  Take 10 people and measure the strength of their dominant arm and their non-dominant arm.

> **Solution:**
> Dependent, since you can match the two arm strengths. The individuals are the same for both samples. So the knowledge of one person's dominant arm strength will tell you something about the strength of their non-dominant arm.

To analyze data when there are matched or paired samples, called dependent samples, you conduct a paired t-test. Since the samples are matched, you can find the difference between the values of the two random variables.

**Hypothesis Test for Two Sample Paired t-Test**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

> = random variable 1

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

> Also, state your level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of *n* pairs is taken.

b.  The population of the difference between random variables is     normally distributed. In this case the population you are interested     in has to do with the differences that you find. It does not matter     if each random variable is normally distributed. It is only     important if the differences you find are normally distributed. Just     as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the     sample size is large. This means that if this assumption isn't met,     but your sample size is quite large (over 30), then the results of     the t-test are valid.

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

5.  Conclusion

> This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value \< , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject

6.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true.

**Confidence Interval for Difference in Means from Paired Samples
(t-Interval)**

The confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for two paired samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means, and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.

1.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

> Sample Statistic:
>
> Difference:
>
> Sample mean of the differences:
>
> Standard deviation of the differences:
>
> Number of pairs:
>
> Confidence Interval:
>
> The confidence interval estimate of the difference is
>
> is the critical value where degrees of freedom

2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "there is a     C% chance that the statement contains the true mean difference."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval     contains the true mean difference.

The critical value is a value from the Student's t-distribution. Since a confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error amount from the sample mean, and the interval has a probability of containing the true mean difference, then you can think of this as the statement . To find the critical value, you use table A.2 in the Appendix.

**How to check the assumptions of t-test and confidence interval:**

In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be met. So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are met. So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the assumption that the sample is a random sample, describe how     you took the samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random     and that the samples were dependent.

2.  For the assumption that the population of the differences is normal,     remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6.

**Example \#9.2.2: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples Using the Formula**

> A researcher wants to see if a weight loss program is effective. She measures the weight of 6 randomly selected women before and after the weight loss program (see table \#9.2.1). Is there evidence that the weight loss program is effective? Test at the 5% level.
>

  Weight after    143   151   156   161   152   154

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

> = weight of a woman after the weight loss program
>
> = weight of a woman before the weight loss program
>
> = mean weight of a woman after the weight loss program
>
> = mean weight of a woman before the weight loss program

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of 6 pairs of weights before and after was taken.     This was stated in the problem, since the women were chosen     randomly.

b.  The population of the difference in after and before weights is     normally distributed. To see if this is true, look at the histogram,     number of outliers, and the normal probability plot. (If you wish,     you can look at the normal probability plot first. If it doesn't     look linear, then you may want to look at the histogram and number     of outliers at this point.)

5.  Conclusion

> Since the p-value \< 0.05, reject .

6.  Interpretation

> There is enough evidence to show that the weight loss program is effective.

Note: Just because the hypothesis test says the program is effective doesn't mean you should go out and use it right away. The program has statistical significance, but that doesn't mean it has practical significance. You need to see how much weight a person loses, and you need to look at how safe it is, how expensive, does it work in the long term, and other type questions. Remember to look at the practical significance in all situations. In this case, the average weight loss was 21.5 pounds, which is very practically significant. Do remember to look at the safety and expense of the drug also.

**Example \#9.2.3: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples Using Technology**

> The New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data in centimeters (cm) is in table \#9.2.3 (\"NZ helmet size,\" 2013). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that there is a difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers? Use a 5% level of significance.

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

> = head measurement of recruit using cardboard caliper
>
> = head measurement of recruit using metal caliper
>
> = mean head measurement of recruit using cardboard caliper
>
> = mean head measurement of recruit using metal caliper

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of 18 pairs of head measures of recruits with     cardboard and metal caliper was taken. This was not stated, but     probably could be safely assumed. 

b.  The population of the difference in head measurements between     cardboard and metal calipers is normally distributed. To see if this     is true, look at the histogram, number of outliers, and the normal     probability plot. (If you wish, you can look at the normal     probability plot first. If it doesn't look linear, then you may want     to look at the histogram and number of outliers at this point.)

5.  Conclusion

> Since the p-value \< 0.05, reject .

6.  Interpretation

> There is enough evidence to show that the mean head measurements using the cardboard calipers are not the same as when using the metal calipers. So it looks like the New Zealand Air Force shouldn't use the cardboard calipers.

**Example \#9.2.4: Confidence Interval for Paired Samples Using the
Formula**

> A researcher wants to estimate the mean weight loss that people experience using a new program. She measures the weight of 6 randomly selected women before and after the weight loss program (see table \#9.2.1). Find a 90% confidence interval for the mean the weight loss using the new program.
>
> **Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

These were stated in example \#9.2.2, but are reproduced here for reference.

> = weight of a woman after the weight loss program
>
> = weight of a woman before the weight loss program
>
> = mean weight of a woman after the weight loss program
>
> = mean weight of a woman before the weight loss program

2.  State and check the assumptions for the confidence interval

> The assumptions were stated and checked in example \#9.2.2.

3.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

> Sample Statistics:

> From example \#9.2.2

> The confidence level is 90%, so
>
> There are six pairs, so the degrees of freedom are
>
> Now look in table A.2. Go down the first column to 5, then over to the
> column headed with 90%.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: There is a 90% chance that contains the     true mean difference in weight loss.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean weight loss is between 18.9 and     24.1 pounds. (Note, the negative signs tell you that the first mean     is less than the second mean, and thus a weight loss in this case.)

**Example \#9.2.5: Confidence Interval for Paired Samples Using Technology**

> The New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn't fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data in centimeters (cm) is in table \#9.2.3 (\"NZ helmet size,\" 2013). Estimate the mean difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers using a 95% confidence interval.

**Solution:**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

These were stated in example \#9.2.3, but are reproduced here for reference.

4.  Statistical Interpretation: There is a 95% chance that contains the     true mean difference in head measurements between cardboard and     metal calibers.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean difference in head measurements     between the cardboard and metal calibers is between 0.54 and     2.68 cm. This means that the cardboard calibers measure on average     the head of a recruit to be between 0.54 and 2.68 cm more in     diameter than the metal calibers. That makes it seem that the     cardboard calibers are not measuring the same as the metal calibers.     (The positive values on the confidence interval imply that the first     mean is higher than the second mean.)

Examples \#9.2.2 and \#9.2.4 use the same data set, but one is conducting a hypothesis test and the other is conducting a confidence interval. Notice that the hypothesis test's conclusion was to reject and say that there was a difference in the means, and the confidence interval does not contain the number 0. If the confidence interval did contain the number 0, then that would mean that the two means could be the same. Since the interval did not contain 0, then you could say that the means are different just as in the hypothesis test. This means that the hypothesis test and the confidence interval can produce the same interpretation. Do be careful though, you can run a hypothesis test with a particular significance level and a confidence interval with a confidence level that is not compatible with your significance level. This will mean that the conclusion from the confidence interval would not be the same as with a hypothesis test. So if you want to estimate the mean difference, then conduct a confidence interval. If you want to show that the means are different, then conduct a hypothesis test.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test or interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test or confidence interval.

1.  The cholesterol level of patients who had heart attacks was measured     two days after the heart attack and then again four days after the     heart attack. The researchers want to see if the cholesterol level     of patients who have heart attacks reduces as the time since their     heart attack increases. The data is in table \#9.2.4 (\"Cholesterol     levels after,\" 2013). Do the data show that the mean cholesterol     level of patients that have had a heart attack reduces as the time     increases since their heart attack? Test at the 1% level.

10. The female labor force participation rates of women in randomly     selected countries in 1990 and latest years of the 1990s are in     table \#9.2.8 (Lim, 2002). Estimate the mean difference in the     female labor force participation rate in 1990 to latest years of the     1990s using a 95% confidence level?

11. Table \#9.2.9 contains pulse rates collected from males, who are     non-smokers but do drink alcohol (\"Pulse rates before,\" 2013). The     before pulse rate is before they exercised, and the after pulse rate     was taken after the subject ran in place for one minute. Do the data     indicate that the pulse rate before exercise is less than after     exercise? Test at the 1% level.

## Independent Samples for Two Means

This section will look at how to analyze when two samples are collected that are independent. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and assumptions are different. The only difference with the independent t-test, as opposed to the other tests that have been done, is that there are actually two different formulas to use depending on if a particular assumption is met or not.

**Hypothesis Test for Independent t-Test (2-Sample t-Test)**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words.

> = random variable 1
>
> = random variable 2
>
> = mean of random variable 1
>
> = mean of random variable 2

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

> The normal hypotheses would be
>
> or
>
> Also, state your level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of size is taken from population 1. A random sample     of size is taken from population 2. Note: the samples do not need to     be the same size, but the test is more robust if they are.

b.  The two samples are independent.

c.  Population 1 is normally distributed. Population 2 is normally     distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the     assumption if the sample size is large. This means that if this     assumption isn't met, but your sample sizes are quite large (over     30), then the results of the t-test are valid.

d.  The population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal.     The old assumption is that the variances are equal. However, this     assumption is no longer an assumption that most statisticians use.     This is because it isn't really realistic to assume that the     variances are equal. So we will just assume the assumption of the     variances being unknown and not assumed to be equal is true, and it     will not be checked.

<!-- -->

4.  Find the sample statistic, test statistic, and p-value

> Calculate

> Using R:
>
> (Note: if , then use . If , then use . If , then find the p-value for , and multiply by 2.)

5.  Conclusion

> This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value \< , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject

6.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true.

**Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples (2 Samp T-Int)**

The confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for independent samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven't completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.

1.  Find the sample statistic and confidence interval

> Sample Statistic:
>
> Calculate
>
> Confidence Interval:

> The confidence interval estimate of the difference is
>
> Since the assumption that isn't being satisfied, then
>
> where is the critical value with degrees of freedom:
>
> Degrees of freedom: (the Welch--Satterthwaite equation)

2.  Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, "there is a     C% chance that contains the true mean difference."

3.  Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval     contains the true difference in means, though often you state how     much more (or less) the first mean is from the second mean.

The critical value is a value from the Student's t-distribution. Since a confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error amount from the difference in sample means, and the interval has a probability of containing the true difference in means, then you can think of this as the statement . To find the critical value you use table A.2 in the Appendix.

**How to check the assumptions of two sample t-test and confidence interval:**

In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be true. So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are true. So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:

1.  For the random sample assumption, describe how you took the two     samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random for both     samples.

2.  For the independent assumption, describe how they are independent     samples.

3.  For the assumption about each population being normally distributed,     remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6. Make     sure you assess each sample separately.

4.  You do not need to check the equal variance assumption since it is     not being assumed.

**Example \#9.3.1: Hypothesis Test for Two Means**

> The cholesterol level of patients who had heart attacks was measured two days after the heart attack. The researchers want to see if patients who have heart attacks have higher cholesterol levels over healthy people, so they also measured the cholesterol level of healthy adults who show no signs of heart disease. The data is in table \#9.3.1 (\"Cholesterol levels after,\" 2013). Do the data show that people who have had heart attacks have higher cholesterol levels over patients that have not had heart attacks? Test at the 1% level.

a.  A random sample of 28 cholesterol levels of patients who had a heart     attack is taken. A random sample of 30 cholesterol levels of healthy     individuals is taken. The problem does not state if either sample     was randomly selected. So this assumption may not be valid.

b.  The two samples are independent. This is because either they were     dealing with patients who had heart attacks or healthy individuals.

c.  Population of all cholesterol levels of patients who had a heart     attack is normally distributed. Population of all cholesterol levels     of healthy individuals is normally distributed.

    Patients who had heart attacks:

    had Heart Attacks**

    height="2.4305555555555554in"}

    This looks somewhat linear.

    So, the population of all cholesterol levels of patients who had
    heart attacks is probably somewhat normally distributed.

    Healthy individuals:

    Individuals**

    This does not look bell shaped.

    ![](media/image284.emf){width="2.3194444444444446in"
    height="2.3194444444444446in"}

    This doesn't look linear.

    So, the population of all cholesterol levels of healthy individuals
    is probably not normally distributed.

    This assumption is not valid for the second sample. Since the sample
    is fairly large, and the t-test is robust, it may not be an issue.
    However, just realize that the conclusions of the test may not be
    valid.

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of 20 sodium levels in beef hotdogs is taken. A
    random sample of 20 sodium levels in poultry hotdogs. The problem
    does not state if either sample was randomly selected. So this
    assumption may not be valid.

b.  The two samples are independent since these are different types of
    hotdogs.

c.  Population of all sodium levels in beef hotdogs is normally
    distributed. Population of all sodium levels in poultry hotdogs is
    normally distributed.

    Beef Hotdogs:

    ![](media/image338.emf){width="3.0416666666666665in"
    height="3.0416666666666665in"}

    This looks somewhat bell shaped.

    Hotdogs**

    ![](media/image339.emf){width="2.138888888888889in"
    height="2.138888888888889in"}

    There are no outliers.

    ![](media/image340.emf){width="2.2777777777777777in"
    height="2.2777777777777777in"}

    This looks somewhat linear.

    So, the population of all sodium levels in beef hotdogs may be
    normally distributed.

    Poultry Hotdogs:

    **Figure \#9.3.14: Histogram of Sodium Levels in Poultry Hotdogs**

    ![](media/image341.emf){width="2.388888888888889in"
    height="2.388888888888889in"}

    This does not look bell shaped.

    **Figure \#9.3.15: Modified Box Plot of Sodium Levels in Poultry
    Hotdogs**

    ![](media/image342.emf){width="2.5833333333333335in"

    There are no outliers.

    **Figure \#9.3.16: Normal Quantile Plot of Sodium Levels in Poultry
    Hotdogs**

    ![](media/image343.emf){width="3.0416666666666665in"
    height="3.0416666666666665in"}

    This does not look linear.

    So, the population of all sodium levels in poultry hotdogs is
    probably not normally distributed.

    This assumption is not valid. Since the samples are fairly large,
    and the t-test is robust, it may not be a large issue. However, just
    realize that the conclusions of the test may not be valid.

d.  The population variances are equal, i.e. .

    Using TI-83/84:

    Using R:

    So you can say that these variances are equal.

Note: the Pooled question on the calculator is for whether you are using
the pooled standard deviation or not. In this example, the pooled
standard deviation was used since you are assuming the variances are
equal. That is why the answer to the question is Yes.

Using R: the command is t.test(variable1, variable2,
alternative=\"less\" or \"greater\")

For this example, the command is

t.test(beef, poultry, alternative=\"less\", equalvar=TRUE)

4.  Statistical Interpretation: There is a 95% chance that contains the
    true difference in means.

5.  Real World Interpretation: The mean sodium level of beef hotdogs is
    anywhere from 108.20 g less than the mean sodium level of poultry
    hotdogs to 10.10 g more. (The negative sign on the lower limit
    implies that the first mean is less than the second mean. The
    positive sign on the upper limit implies that the first mean is
    greater than the second mean.)

    Realize that many of assumptions are not valid in this example, so
    the interpretation may be invalid.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test or interval may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test or confidence interval. Unless directed by your instructor, do not assume the variances are equal (except in problems 11 through 16).

9.  A vitamin K shot is given to infants soon after birth. Nurses at     Northbay Healthcare were involved in a study to see if how they     handle the infants could reduce the pain the infants feel (\"SOCR     data nips,\" 2013). One of the measurements taken was how long, in     seconds, the infant cried after being given the shot. A random     sample was taken from the group that was given the shot using     conventional methods (table \#9.3.11), and a random sample was taken     from the group that was given the shot where the mother held the     infant prior to and during the shot (table \#9.3.12). Is there     enough evidence to show that infants cried less on average when they     are held by their mothers than if held using conventional methods?     Test at the 5% level.

10. A vitamin K shot is given to infants soon after birth. Nurses at     Northbay Healthcare were involved in a study to see if how they     handle the infants could reduce the pain the infants feel (\"SOCR     data nips,\" 2013). One of the measurements taken was how long, in     seconds, the infant cried after being given the shot. A random     sample was taken from the group that was given the shot using     conventional methods (table \#9.3.11), and a random sample was taken     from the group that was given the shot where the mother held the     infant prior to and during the shot (table \#9.3.12). Calculate a     95% confidence interval for the mean difference in mean crying time     after being given a vitamin K shot between infants held using     conventional methods and infants held by their mothers.

## Which Analysis Should You Conduct?

One of the most important concept that you need to understand is deciding which analysis you should conduct for a particular situation. To help you to figure out the analysis to conduct, there are a series of questions you should ask yourself.

1.  Does the problem deal with mean or proportion?

> Sometimes the problem states explicitly the words mean or proportion, but other times you have to figure it out based on the information you are given. If you counted number of individuals that responded in the affirmative to a question, then you are dealing with proportion. If you measured something, then you are dealing with mean.

2.  Does the problem have one or two samples?

> So look to see if one group was measured or if two groups were measured. If you have the data sets, then it is usually easy to figure out if there is one or two samples, then there is either one data set or two data sets. If you don't have the data, then you need to decide if the problem describes collecting data from one group or from two groups.

3.  If you have two samples, then you need to determine if the samples     are independent or dependent.

If the individuals are different for both samples, then most likely     the samples are independent. If you can't tell, then determine if a     data value from the first sample influences the data value in the     second sample. In other words, can you pair data values together so     you can find the difference, and that difference has meaning. If the     answer is yes, then the samples are paired. Otherwise, the samples     are independent.

4.  Does the situation involve a hypothesis test or a confidence     interval?

    If the problem talks about \"do the data show\", \"is there evidence     of\", \"test to see\", then you are doing a hypothesis test. If the     problem talks about \"find the value\", \"estimate the\" or \"find     the interval\", then you are doing a confidence interval.

So if you have a situation that has two samples, independent samples, involving the mean, and is a hypothesis test, then you have a two-sample independent t-test. Now you look up the assumptions and the formula or technology process for doing this test. Every hypothesis test involves the same six steps, and you just have to use the correct assumptions and calculations. Every confidence interval has the same five steps, and again you just need to use the correct assumptions and calculations. So this is why it is so important to figure out what analysis you should conduct.
