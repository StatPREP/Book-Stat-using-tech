# Chi-Square and ANOVA Tests

This chapter presents material on three more hypothesis tests. One is used to determine significant relationship between two qualitative variables, the second is used to determine if the sample data has a particular distribution, and the last is used to determine significant relationships between means of 3 or more samples.

## Chi-Square Test for Independence

Remember, qualitative data is where you collect data on individuals that are categories or names. Then you would count how many of the individuals had particular qualities. An example is that there is a theory that there is a relationship between breastfeeding and autism. To determine if there is a relationship, researchers could collect the time period that a mother breastfed her child and if that child was diagnosed with autism. Then you would have a table containing this information. Now you want to know if each cell is independent of each other cell. Remember, independence says that one event does not affect another event. Here it means that having autism is independent of being breastfed. What you really want is to see if they are not independent. In other words, does one affect the other? If you were to do a hypothesis test, this is your alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis is that they are independent. There is a hypothesis test for this and it is called the **Chi-Square Test for Independence**. Technically it should be called the Chi-Square Test for Dependence, but for historical reasons it is known as the test for independence. Just as with previous hypothesis tests, all the steps are the same except for the assumptions and the test statistic.

**Hypothesis Test for Chi-Square Test**

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of     significance

- the two variables are independent (this means that the one variable is not affected by the other) 
- the two variables are dependent (this means that the one variable is > affected by the other) 
- Also, state your level here.

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample is taken.

b.  Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5     (The expected frequencies, *E*, will be calculated later, and this     assumption means ).

<!-- -->

3.  Find the test statistic and p-value

> Finding the test statistic involves several steps. First the data is collected and counted, and then it is organized into a table (in a table each entry is called a cell). These values are known as the observed frequencies, which the symbol for an observed frequency is *O*. Each table is made up of rows and columns. Then each row is totaled to give a row total and each column is totaled to give a column total.
>
> The null hypothesis is that the variables are independent. Using the multiplication rule for independent events you can calculate the probability of being one value of the first variable, *A*, and one value of the second variable, *B* (the probability of a particular cell ). Remember in a hypothesis test, you assume that is true, the two variables are assumed to be independent.
>
> Now you want to find out how many individuals you expect to be in a certain cell. To find the expected frequencies, you just need to multiply the probability of that cell times the total number of individuals. Do not round the expected frequencies.
>
> If the variables are independent the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies should be the same. The test statistic here will involve looking at the difference between the expected frequency and the observed frequency for each cell. Then you want to find the "total difference" of all of these differences. The larger the total, the smaller the chances that you could find that test statistic given that the assumption of independence is true. That means that the assumption of independence is not true. How do you find the test statistic? First find the differences between the observed and expected frequencies. Because some of these differences will be positive and some will be negative, you need to square these differences. These squares could be large just because the frequencies are large, you need to divide by the expected frequencies to scale them. Then finally add up all of these fractional values. This is the test statistic.

**Test Statistic:**

> The symbol for Chi-Square is
>
> where *O* is the observed frequency and *E* is the expected frequency

**\
**

**Distribution of Chi-Square**

> has different curves depending on the degrees of freedom. It is skewed
> to the right for small degrees of freedom and gets more symmetric as
> the degrees of freedom increases (see figure \#11.1.1). Since the test
> statistic involves squaring the differences, the test statistics are
> all positive. A chi-squared test for independence is always right
> tailed.

p-value:

> Using the TI-83/84:
>
> Using R:
>
> Where the degrees of freedom is

4.  Conclusion

> This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value \< , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject

5.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true.

**Example \#11.1.1: Hypothesis Test with Chi-Square Test Using Formula**

> Is there a relationship between autism and breastfeeding? To determine if there is, a researcher asked mothers of autistic and non-autistic children to say what time period they breastfed their children. The data is in table \#11.1.1 (Schultz, Klonoff-Cohen, Wingard, Askhoomoff, Macera, Ji & Bacher, 2006). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that that breastfeeding and autism are independent? Test at the 1% level.

Test statistic:

> To use the TI-83/84 calculator to compute the test statistic, you must first put the data into the calculator. However, this process is different than for other hypothesis tests. You need to put the data in as a matrix instead of in the list. Go into the MATRX menu then move over to EDIT and choose 1:\[A\]. This will allow you to type the table into the calculator. Figure \#11.1.2 shows what you will see on your calculator when you choose 1:\[A\] from the EDIT menu.

>
> The table has 2 rows and 4 columns (don't include the row total column and the column total row in your count). You need to tell the calculator that you have a 2 by 4. The 1 X1 (you might have another size in your matrix, but it doesn't matter because you will change it) on the calculator is the size of the matrix. So type 2 ENTER and 4 ENTER and the calculator will make a matrix of the correct size. See figure \#11.1.3.

> The World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of how many incidents of leprosy there are in the world. Using the WHO regions and the World Banks income groups, one can ask if an income level and a WHO region are dependent on each other in terms of predicting where the disease is.

> **Solution:**

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of
    significance

> WHO region and Income Level when dealing with the disease of leprosy are independent
>
> WHO region and Income Level when dealing with the disease of leprosy are dependent

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of incidence of leprosy was taken from different     countries and the income level and WHO region was taken.

b.  Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5     (ie. ). See step 3. There are actually 4 expected frequencies that     are less than 5, and the results of the test may not be valid. If     you look at the expected frequencies you will notice that they are     all in Europe. This is because Europe didn't have many cases     in 2011.

4.  Conclusion

> Reject since the p-value is less than 0.05.

5.  Interpretation

> There is enough evidence to show that WHO region and income level are dependent when dealing with the disease of leprosy. WHO can decide how to focus their efforts based on region and income level. Do remember though that the results may not be valid due to the expected frequencies not all be more than 5.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.

3.  Is there a relationship between autism and what an infant is fed? To     determine if there is, a researcher asked mothers of autistic and     non-autistic children to say what they fed their infant. The data is     in table \#11.1.7 (Schultz, Klonoff-Cohen, Wingard, Askhoomoff,     Macera, Ji & Bacher, 2006).

## Chi-Square Goodness of Fit

In probability, you calculated probabilities using both experimental and theoretical methods. There are times when it is important to determine how well the experimental values match the theoretical values. An example of this is if you wish to verify if a die is fair. To determine if observed values fit the expected values, you want to see if the difference between observed values and expected values is large enough to say that the test statistic is unlikely to happen if you assume that the observed values fit the expected values. The test statistic in this case is also the chi-square. The process is the same as for the chi-square test for independence.

**Hypothesis Test for Goodness of Fit Test**

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

> The data are consistent with a specific distribution
>
> The data are not consistent with a specific distribution
>
> Also, state your level here.

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample is taken.

b.  Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5     (The expected frequencies, *E*, will be calculated later, and this     assumption means ).

<!-- -->

3.  Find the test statistic and p-value

> Finding the test statistic involves several steps. First the data is collected and counted, and then it is organized into a table (in a table each entry is called a cell). These values are known as the observed frequencies, which the symbol for an observed frequency is *O*. The table is made up of *k* entries. The total number of observed frequencies is *n*. The expected frequencies are calculated by multiplying the probability of each entry, *p*, times *n*.

**Test Statistic:**

> where *O* is the observed frequency and *E* is the expected frequency
>
> Again, the test statistic involves squaring the differences, so the test statistics are all positive. Thus a chi-squared test for goodness of fit is always right tailed.

p-value:

> Using the TI-83/84:
>
> Using R:
>
> Where the degrees of freedom is

4.  Conclusion

> This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value \< , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject

5.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true.

**Example \#11.2.1: Goodness of Fit Test Using the Formula**

> Suppose you have a die that you are curious if it is fair or not. If it is fair then the proportion for each value should be the same. You need to find the observed frequencies and to accomplish this you roll the die 500 times and count how often each side comes up. The data is in table \#11.2.1. Do the data show that the die is fair? Test at the 5% level.

1.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

> The observed frequencies are consistent with the distribution for fair die (the die is fair)
>
> The observed frequencies are not consistent with the distribution for fair die (the die is not fair)

2.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample is taken since each throw of a die is a random     event.

b.  Expected frequencies for each cell are greater than or equal to 5.     See step 3.

<!-- -->

3.  Find the test statistic and p-value

> First you need to find the probability of rolling each side of the die. The sample space for rolling a die is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Since you are assuming that the die is fair, then [MISSING].

> Now you can find the expected frequency for each side of the die. Since all the probabilities are the same, then each expected frequency is the same.

### Homework

In each problem show all steps of the hypothesis test. If some of the assumptions are not met, note that the results of the test may not be correct and then continue the process of the hypothesis test.

1.  According to the M&M candy company, the expected proportion can be     found in Table \#11.2.3. In addition, the table contains the number     of M&M's of each color that were found in a case of candy (Madison,     2013). At the 5% level, do the observed frequencies support the     claim of M&M?

3.  On occasion, medical studies need to model the proportion of the     population that has a disease and compare that to observed     frequencies of the disease actually occurring. Suppose the end-stage     renal failure in south-west Wales was collected for different age     groups. Do the data in table 11.2.5 show that the observed     frequencies are in agreement with proportion of people in each age     group (Boyle, Flowerdew & Williams, 1997)? Test at the 1% level.

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

There are times where you want to compare three or more population means. One idea is to just test different combinations of two means. The problem with that is that your chance for a type I error increases. Instead you need a process for analyzing all of them at the same time. This process is known as **analysis of variance (ANOVA)**. The test statistic for the ANOVA is fairly complicated, you will want to use technology to find the test statistic and p-value. The test statistic is distributed as an F-distribution, which is skewed right and depends on degrees of freedom. Since you will use technology to find these, the distribution and the test statistic will not be presented. Remember, all hypothesis tests are the same process. Note that to obtain a statistically significant result there need only be a difference between any two of the *k* means.

Before conducting the hypothesis test, it is helpful to look at the means and standard deviations for each data set. If the sample means with consideration of the sample standard deviations are different, it may mean that some of the population means are different. However, do realize that if they are different, it doesn't provide enough evidence to show the population means are different. Calculating the sample statistics just gives you an idea that conducting the hypothesis test is a good idea.

**Hypothesis test using ANOVA to compare *k* means**

1.  State the random variables and the parameters in words

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of significance

> Also, state your level here.

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of size is taken from each population.

b.  All the samples are independent of each other.

c.  Each population is normally distributed. The ANOVA test is fairly     robust to the assumption especially if the sample sizes are fairly     close to each other. Unless the populations are really not normally     distributed and the sample sizes are close to each other, then this     is a loose assumption.

d.  The population variances are all equal. If the sample sizes are     close to each other, then this is a loose assumption. 
<!-- -->

4.  Find the test statistic and p-value

> The test statistic is , where is the mean square between the groups (or factors), and is the mean square within the groups. The degrees of freedom between the groups is and the degrees of freedom within the groups is . To find all of the values, use technology such as the TI-83/84 calculator or R.
>
> The test statistic, *F*, is distributed as an F-distribution, where both degrees of freedom are needed in this distribution. The p-value is also calculated by the calculator or R.

5.  Conclusion

> This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the p-value \< , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject

6.  Interpretation

> This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true.

If you do in fact reject , then you know that at least two of the means are different. The next question you might ask is which are different? You can look at the sample means, but realize that these only give a preliminary result. To actually determine which means are different, you need to conduct other tests. Some of these tests are the range test, multiple comparison tests, Duncan test, Student-Newman-Keuls test, Tukey test, Scheffé test, Dunnett test, least significant different test, and the Bonferroni test. There is no consensus on which test to use. These tests are available in statistical computer packages such as Minitab and SPSS.

**Example \#11.3.1: Hypothesis Test Involving Several Means**

> Cancer is a terrible disease. Surviving may depend on the type of cancer the person has. To see if the mean survival time for several types of cancer are different, data was collected on the survival time in days of patients with one of these cancer in advanced stage. The data is in table \#11.3.1 (\"Cancer survival story,\" 2013). (Please realize that this data is from 1978. There have been many advances in cancer treatment, so do not use this data as an indication of survival rates from these cancers.) Do the data indicate that at least two of the mean survival time for these types of cancer are not all equal? Test at the 1% level.

2.  State the null and alternative hypotheses and the level of     significance

3.  State and check the assumptions for the hypothesis test

<!-- -->

a.  A random sample of 13 survival times from stomach cancer was taken.     A random sample of 17 survival times from bronchus cancer was taken.     A random sample of 17 survival times from colon cancer was taken. A     random sample of 6 survival times from ovarian cancer was taken. A     random sample of 11 survival times from breast cancer was taken.     These statements may not be true. This information was not shared as     to whether the samples were random or not but it may be safe to     assume that.

b.  Since the individuals have different cancers, then the samples are     independent.

c.  Population of all survival times from stomach cancer is normally     distributed. Population of all survival times from bronchus cancer     is normally distributed. Population of all survival times from colon     cancer is normally distributed. Population of all survival times     from ovarian cancer is normally distributed. Population of all     survival times from breast cancer is normally distributed. Looking     at the histograms, box plots and normal quantile plots for each     sample, it appears that none of the populations are normally     distributed. The sample sizes are somewhat different for the     problem. This assumption may not be true.

d.  The population variances are all equal. The sample standard     deviations are approximately 346.3, 209.9, 427.2, 1098.6, and 1239.0     respectively. This assumption does not appear to be met, since the     sample standard deviations are very different. The sample sizes are     somewhat different for the problem. This assumption may not be true.

4.  Find the test statistic and p-value

> To find the test statistic and p-value using the TI-83/84, type each data set into L1 through L5. Then go into STAT and over to TESTS and choose ANOVA(. Then type in L1,L2,L3,L4,L5 and press enter. You will get the results of the ANOVA test.

2.  Levi-Strauss Co manufactures clothing. The quality control     department measures weekly values of different suppliers for the     percentage difference of waste between the layout on the computer     and the actual waste when the clothing is made (called run-up). The     data is in table \#11.3.3, and there are some negative values     because sometimes the supplier is able to layout the pattern better     than the computer (\"Waste run up,\" 2013). Do the data show that     there is a difference between some of the suppliers? Test at the 1%     level.

3.  Several magazines were grouped into three categories based on what     level of education of their readers the magazines are geared     towards: high, medium, or low level. Then random samples of the     magazines were selected to determine the number of     three-plus-syllable words were in the advertising copy, and the data     is in table \#11.3.4 (\"Magazine ads readability,\" 2013). Is there     enough evidence to show that the mean number of three-plus-syllable     words in advertising copy is different for at least two of the     education levels? Test at the 5% level.

4.  A study was undertaken to see how accurate food labeling for     calories on food that is considered reduced calorie. The group     measured the amount of calories for each item of food and then found     the percent difference between measured and labeled food, . The     group also looked at food that was nationally advertised, regionally     distributed, or locally prepared. The data is in table \#11.3.5     (\"Calories datafile,\" 2013). Do the data indicate that at least     two of the mean percent differences between the three groups are     different? Test at the 10% level.
