<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Basics of Probability Distributions</h2>
<p>As a reminder, a variable or what will be called the random variable from now on, is represented by the letter <em>x</em> and it represents a quantitative (numerical) variable that is measured or observed in an experiment.</p>
<p>Also remember there are different types of quantitative variables, called discrete or continuous. What is the difference between discrete and continuous data? <strong>Discrete</strong> data can only take on particular values in a range. <strong>Continuous</strong> data can take on any value in a range. Discrete data usually arises from counting while continuous data usually arises from measuring.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of each:</strong></p>
<p>How tall is a plant given a new fertilizer? Continuous. This is something you measure.</p>
<p>How many fleas are on prairie dogs in a colony? Discrete. This is something you count.</p>
<p>If you have a variable, and can find a probability associated with that variable, it is called a <strong>random variable</strong>. In many cases the random variable is what you are measuring, but when it comes to discrete random variables, it is usually what you are counting. So for the example of how tall is a plant given a new fertilizer, the random variable is the height of the plant given a new fertilizer. For the example of how many fleas are on prairie dogs in a colony, the random variable is the number of fleas on a prairie dog in a colony.</p>
<p>Now suppose you put all the values of the random variable together with the probability that that random variable would occur. You could then have a distribution like before, but now it is called a probability distribution since it involves probabilities. A <strong>probability distribution</strong> is an assignment of probabilities to the values of the random variable. The abbreviation of pdf is used for a probability distribution function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 2010 U.S. Census found the chance of a household being a certain
size. The data is in table #5.1.1 (&quot;Households by age,&quot; 2013).</p>

<p>Just as with any data set, you can calculate the mean and standard
deviation. In problems involving a probability distribution function
(pdf), you consider the probability distribution the population even
though the pdf in most cases come from repeating an experiment many
times. This is because you are using the data from repeated experiments
to estimate the true probability. Since a pdf is basically a population,
the mean and standard deviation that are calculated are actually the
population parameters and not the sample statistics. The notation used
is the same as the notation for population mean and population standard
deviation that was used in chapter 3. Note: the mean can be thought of
as the <strong>expected value</strong>. It is the value you expect to get if the
trials were repeated infinite number of times. The mean or expected
value does not need to be a whole number, even if the possible values of
<em>x</em> are whole numbers.</p>
<p>For a discrete probability distribution function,</p>
<p>The mean or expected value is</p>
<p>The variance is</p>
<p>The standard deviation is</p>
<p>where <em>x</em> = the value of the random variable and <em>P(x)</em> = the
probability corresponding to a particular <em>x</em> value.</p>

<p>To find the mean it is easier to just use a table as shown below.
Consider the category 7 or more to just be 7. The formula for the mean
says to multiply the <em>x</em> value by the <em>P(x)</em> value, so add a row into
the table for this calculation. Also convert all <em>P(x)</em> to decimal form.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>To find the expected value, you need to first create the probability
distribution. In this case, the random variable <em>x</em> = winnings. If you
pick the right numbers in the right order, then you win $500, but you
paid $1 to play, so you actually win $499. If you didn’t pick the
right numbers, you lose the $1, the <em>x</em> value is . You also need the
probability of winning and losing. Since you are picking a three-digit
number, and for each digit there are 10 numbers you can pick with each
independent of the others, you can use the multiplication rule. To
win, you have to pick the right numbers in the right order. The first
digit, you pick 1 number out of 10, the second digit you pick 1 number
out of 10, and the third digit you pick 1 number out of 10. The
probability of picking the right number in the right order is . The
probability of losing (not winning) would be . Putting this
information into a table will help to calculate the expected value.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The reason probability is studied in statistics is to help in making
decisions in inferential statistics. To understand how that is done the
concept of a rare event is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics</strong></p>
<p>If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed
event is extremely small, then you can conclude that the assumption is
probably not correct.</p>
<p>An example of this is suppose you roll an assumed fair die 1000 times
and get a six 600 times, when you should have only rolled a six around
160 times, then you should believe that your assumption about it being a
fair die is untrue.</p>
<p><strong>Determining if an event is unusual</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking at a value of x for a discrete variable, and the
<em>P</em>(the variable has a value of x or more) &lt; 0.05, then you can
consider the x an unusually high value.  Another way to think of this is
if the probability of getting such a high value is less than 0.05, then
the event of getting the value x is unusual.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the <em>P</em>(the variable has a value of x or less) &lt; 0.05,
then you can consider this an unusually low value. Another way to think
of this is if the probability of getting a value as small as x is less
than 0.05, then the event x is considered unusual.</p>
<p>Why is it &quot;x or more&quot; or &quot;x or less&quot; instead of just &quot;x&quot; when you
are determining if an event is unusual? Consider this example: you and
your friend go out to lunch every day.  Instead of Going Dutch (each
paying for their own lunch), you decide to flip a coin, and the loser
pays for both.  Your friend seems to be winning more often than you'd
expect, so you want to determine if this is unusual before you decide to
change how you pay for lunch (or accuse your friend of cheating).  The
process for how to calculate these probabilities will be presented in
the next section on the binomial distribution.  If your friend won 6 out
of 10 lunches, the probability of that happening turns out to be about
20.5%, not unusual.  The probability of winning 6 or more is about
37.7%.  But what happens if your friend won 501 out of 1,000 lunches? 
That doesn't seem so unlikely!  The probability of winning 501 or more
lunches is about 47.8%, and that is consistent with your hunch that this
isn't so unusual.  But the probability of winning exactly 501 lunches
is much less, only about 2.5%.  That is why the probability of getting
exactly that value is not the right question to ask: you should ask the
probability of getting that value or more (or that value or less on the
other side).</p>
<p>The value 0.05 will be explained later, and it is not the only value you
can use.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Binomial Probability Distribution</h2>
<p>Section 5.1 introduced the concept of a probability distribution. The
focus of the section was on discrete probability distributions (pdf). To
find the pdf for a situation, you usually needed to actually conduct the
experiment and collect data. Then you can calculate the experimental
probabilities. Normally you cannot calculate the theoretical
probabilities instead. However, there are certain types of experiment
that allow you to calculate the theoretical probability. One of those
types is called a <strong>Binomial Experiment</strong>.</p>
<p>Properties of a <strong>binomial experiment</strong> (or Bernoulli trial):</p>
<p>1) Fixed number of trials, <em>n</em>, which means that the experiment is
repeated a specific number of times.</p>
<p>2) The <em>n</em> trials are independent, which means that what happens on one
trial does not influence the outcomes of other trials.</p>
<p>3) There are only two outcomes, which are called a success and a
failure.</p>
<p>4) The probability of a success doesn’t change from trial to trial,
where <em>p</em> = probability of success and <em>q</em> = probability of failure, .</p>
<p>If you know you have a binomial experiment, then you can calculate
binomial probabilities. This is important because binomial probabilities
come up often in real life. Examples of binomial experiments are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toss a fair coin ten times, and find the probability of getting two
heads.</p>
<p>Question twenty people in class, and look for the probability of more
than half being women?</p>
<p>Shoot five arrows at a target, and find the probability of hitting it
five times?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To develop the process for calculating the probabilities in a binomial
experiment, consider example #5.2.1.</p>
<p><strong>Example #5.2.1: Deriving the Binomial Probability Formula</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you are given a 3 question multiple-choice test. Each question
has 4 responses and only one is correct. Suppose you want to find the
probability that you can just guess at the answers and get 2 questions
right. (Teachers do this all the time when they make up a
multiple-choice test to see if students can still pass without
studying. In most cases the students can’t.) To help with the idea
that you are going to guess, suppose the test is in Martian.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>To answer this question, start with the sample space.</p>
<p>SS = {RRR, RRW, RWR, WRR, WWR, WRW, RWW, WWW}, where RRW means you get
the first question right, the second question right, and the third
question wrong. The same is similar for the other outcomes.</p>
<p>Now the event space for getting 2 right is {RRW, RWR, WRR}. What you
did in chapter four was just to find three divided by eight. However,
this would not be right in this case. That is because the probability
of getting a question right is different from getting a question
wrong. What else can you do?</p>
<p>Look at just P(RRW) for the moment. Again, that means</p>

<p>Hopefully you see the pattern that results. You can now write the
general formula for the probabilities for a Binomial experiment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, the random variable in a binomial experiment is <em>x</em> = number of
successes.</p>
<p>Be careful, a success is not always a good thing. Sometimes a success is
something that is bad, like finding a defect. A success just means you
observed the outcome you wanted to see happen.</p>
<p>Binomial Formula for the probability of <em>r</em> successes in <em>n</em> trials is</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>The is the number of combinations of <em>n</em> things taking <em>r</em> at a time. It
is read “<em>n</em> choose <em>r</em>”. Some other common notations for <em>n</em> choose <em>r</em>
are , and . <em>n!</em> means you are multiplying . As an example, .</p>
<p>When solving problems, make sure you define your random variable and
state what <em>n</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, and <em>r</em> are. Without doing this, the problems
are a great deal harder.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>At most three means that three is the highest value you will have. Find
the probability of <em>x</em> is less than or equal to three.</p>
<p>The reason the answer is written as being greater than 0.999 is because
the answer is actually 0.9999573791, and when that is rounded to three
decimal places you get 1. But 1 means that the event will happen, when
in reality there is a slight chance that it won’t happen. It is best to
write the answer as greater than 0.999 to represent that the number is
very close to 1, but isn’t 1.</p>

<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>At least four have green eyes.</li>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>At least four means four or more. Find the probability of x being
greater than or equal to four. That would mean adding up all the
probabilities from four to twenty. This would take a long time, so it is
better to use the idea of complement. The complement of being greater
than or equal to four is being less than four. That would mean being
less than or equal to three. Part (e) has the answer for the probability
of being less than or equal to three. Just subtract that number from 1.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Actually the answer is less than 0.001, but it is fine to write it this
way.</p>
<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In Europe, four people out of twenty have green eyes. Is this
unusual? What does that tell you?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Since the probability of finding four or more people with green eyes is
much less than 0.05, it is unusual to find four people out of twenty
with green eyes. That should make you wonder if the proportion of people
in Europe with green eyes is more than the 1% for the general
population. If this is true, then you may want to ask why Europeans have
a higher proportion of green-eyed people. That of course could lead to
more questions.</p>
<p>The binomial formula is cumbersome to use, so you can find the
probabilities by using technology. On the TI-83/84 calculator, the
commands on the TI-83/84 calculators when the number of trials is equal
to <em>n</em> and the probability of a success is equal to <em>p</em> are when you
want to find and when you want to find . If you want to find , then you
use the property that , since and are complementary events. Both
binompdf and binomcdf commands are found in the DISTR menu. Using R, the
commands are and .</p>
<p><strong>Example #5.2.3: Using the Binomial Command on the TI-83/84</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When looking at a person’s eye color, it turns out that 1% of people
in the world has green eyes (&quot;What percentage of,&quot; 2013). Consider a
group of 20 people.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<p><em>x</em> = number of people with green eyes</p>

<p>Find the probability that</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>None have green eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>You are looking for . Since this problem is , you use the binompdf
command on the TI-83/84 or dbinom command on R. On the TI-83/84, you go
to the DISTR menu, select the binompdf, and then type into the
parenthesis your <em>n</em>, <em>p</em>, and <em>r</em> values into your calculator, making
sure you use the comma to separate the values. The command will look
like and when you press ENTER you will be given the answer. (If you have
the new software on the TI-84, the screen looks a bit different.)</p>
<p><strong>Figure #5.2.1: Calculator Results for binompdf</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/image62.png" style="width:2.75in;height:1.86111in" /></p>
<p>On R, the command would look like dbinom(0, 20, 0.01)</p>
<p>. Thus there is an 81.8% chance that in a group of 20 people none of
them will have green eyes.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Nine have green eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>In this case you want to find the . Again, you will use the binompdf
command or the dbinom command. Following the procedure above, you will
have on the TI-83/84 or dbinom(9,20,0.01) on R. Your answer is .
(Remember when the calculator gives you and R give you , this is how
they display scientific notation.) The probability that out of twenty
people, nine of them have green eyes is a very small chance.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>At most three have green eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>At most three means that three is the highest value you will have. Find
the probability of <em>x</em> being less than or equal to three, which is .
This uses the binomcdf command on the TI-83/84 and pbinom command in R.
You use the command on the TI-83/84 of and the command on R of
pbinom(3,20,0.01)</p>
<p><strong>Figure #5.2.2: Calculator Results for binomcdf</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/image71.png" style="width:2.75in;height:1.86111in" /></p>
<p>Your answer is 0.99996. Thus there is a really good chance that in a
group of 20 people at most three will have green eyes. (Note: don’t
round this to one, since one means that the event will happen, when in
reality there is a slight chance that it won’t happen. It is best to
write the answer out to enough decimal points so it doesn’t round off to
one.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>At most two have green eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>You are looking for . Again use binomcdf or pbinom. Following the
procedure above you will have on the TI-83/84 and pbinom(2,20,0.01),
with . Again there is a really good chance that at most two people in
the room will have green eyes.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>At least four have green eyes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>At least four means four or more. Find the probability of <em>x</em> being
greater than or equal to four. That would mean adding up all the
probabilities from four to twenty. This would take a long time, so it is
better to use the idea of complement. The complement of being greater
than or equal to four is being less than four. That would mean being
less than or equal to three. Part (e) has the answer for the probability
of being less than or equal to three. Just subtract that number from 1.</p>
<p>. You can also find this answer by doing the following on TI-83/84:</p>
<p>on R:</p>
<p>Again, this is very unlikely to happen.</p>

<li><p>Draw a histogram.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>You can draw the histogram on the TI-83/84 or other technology. The
graph would look like in figure #5.3.1.</p>

<p>This graph is very skewed to the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the mean.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since this is a binomial, then you can use the formula . So</p>
<p>You expect on average that out of 20 people, less than 1 would have green eyes.</p>
