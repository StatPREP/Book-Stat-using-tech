<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> One-Sample Inference</h1>
<p>Now that you have all this information about descriptive statistics and probabilities, it is time to start inferential statistics. There are two branches of inferential statistics: hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> making a decision about a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).</p>
<p><strong>Confidence Interval:</strong> estimating a parameter(s) based on a statistic(s).</p>
<div id="basics-of-hypothesis-testing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Basics of Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>To understand the process of a hypothesis tests, you need to first have an understanding of what a hypothesis is, which is an educated guess about a parameter. Once you have the hypothesis, you collect data and use the data to make a determination to see if there is enough evidence to show that the hypothesis is true. However, in hypothesis testing you actually assume something else is true, and then you look at your data to see how likely it is to get an event that your data demonstrates with that assumption. If the event is very unusual, then you might think that your assumption is actually false. If you are able to say this assumption is false, then your hypothesis must be true. This is known as a proof by contradiction. You assume the opposite of your hypothesis is true and show that it can’t be true. If this happens, then your hypothesis must be true. All hypothesis tests go through the same process. Once you have the process down, then the concept is much easier. It is easier to see the process by looking at an example. Concepts that are needed will be detailed in this example.</p>
<p><strong>Example #7.1.1: Basics of Hypothesis Testing</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose a manufacturer of the XJ35 battery claims the mean life of the battery is 500 days with a standard deviation of 25 days. You are the buyer of this battery and you think this claim is inflated. You would like to test your belief because without a good reason you can’t get out of your contract.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Well first, you should know what you are trying to measure. Define the random variable.</p>
<p>Let <em>x</em> = life of a XJ35 battery</p>
<p>Now you are not just trying to find different <em>x</em> values. You are trying to find what the true mean is. Since you are trying to find it, it must be unknown. You don’t think it is 500 days. If you did, you wouldn’t be doing any testing. The true mean, , is unknown. That means you should define that too.</p>
<p>Let = mean life of a XJ35 battery</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
<p>You may want to collect a sample. What kind of sample?</p>
<p>You could ask the manufacturers to give you batteries, but there is a chance that there could be some bias in the batteries they pick. To reduce the chance of bias, it is best to take a random sample.</p>
<p>How big should the sample be?</p>
<p>A sample of size 30 or more means that you can use the central limit theorem. Pick a sample of size 30.</p>

<p>Now what should you do? Looking at the data set, you see some of the times are above 500 and some are below. But looking at all of the numbers is too difficult. It might be helpful to calculate the mean for this sample.</p>
<p>The sample mean is . Looking at the sample mean, one might think that you are right. However, the standard deviation and the sample size also plays a role, so maybe you are wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Before going any farther, it is time to formalize a few definitions.</p>
<p>You have a guess that the mean life of a battery is less than 500 days. This is opposed to what the manufacturer claims. There really are two hypotheses, which are just guesses here – the one that the manufacturer claims and the one that you believe. It is helpful to have names for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Null Hypothesis</strong>: historical value, claim, or product specification. The symbol used is [MISSING] .</p>
<p><strong>Alternate Hypothesis:</strong> what you want to prove. This is what you want to accept as true when you reject the null hypothesis. There are two symbols that are commonly used for the alternative hypothesis: or [MISSING]. The symbol will be used in this book.</p>
<p>In general, the hypotheses look something like this:</p>
<p>[MISSING EQ]</p>
<p>where just represents the value that the claim says the population mean is actually equal to.</p>
<p>Also, can be less than, greater than, or not equal to.</p>
<p>For this problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>, since the manufacturer says the mean life of a battery is 500 days.</p>
<p>, since you believe that the mean life of the battery is less than 500 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now back to the mean. You have a sample mean of 490 days. Is this small enough to believe that you are right and the manufacturer is wrong? How small does it have to be?</p>
<p>If you calculated a sample mean of 235, you would definitely believe the population mean is less than 500. But even if you had a sample mean of 435 you would probably believe that the true mean was less than 500. What about 475? Or 483? There is some point where you would stop being so sure that the population mean is less than 500. That point separates the values of where you are sure or pretty sure that the mean is less than 500 from the area where you are not so sure. How do you find that point?</p>
<p>Well it depends on how much error you want to make. Of course you don’t want to make any errors, but unfortunately that is unavoidable in statistics. You need to figure out how much error you made with your sample. Take the sample mean, and find the probability of getting another sample mean less than it, assuming for the moment that the manufacturer is right. The idea behind this is that you want to know what is the chance that you could have come up with your sample mean even if the population mean really is 500 days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You want to find</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To compute this probability, you need to know how the sample mean is distributed. Since the sample size is at least 30, then you know the sample mean is approximately normally distributed. Remember and</p>
<p>A picture is always useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="chart"><span class="math display">\[CHART\]</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before calculating the probability, it is useful to see how many standard deviations away from the mean the sample mean is. Using the formula for the <em>z</em>-score from chapter 6, you find</p>
<p>This sample mean is more than two standard deviations away from the mean. That seems pretty far, but you should look at the probability too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On TI-83/84:</p>
<p>On R:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a 1.42% chance that you could find a sample mean less than 490 when the population mean is 500 days. This is really small, so the chances are that the assumption that the population mean is 500 days is wrong, and you can reject the manufacturer’s claim. But how do you quantify really small? Is 5% or 10% or 15% really small? How do you decide?</p>
<p>Before you answer that question, a couple more definitions are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Test statistic:</strong> since it is calculated as part of the testing of the hypothesis</p>
<p><strong>p – value:</strong> probability that the test statistic will take on more extreme values than the observed test statistic, given that the null hypothesis is true. It is the probability that was calculated above.</p>
<p>Now, how small is small enough? To answer that, you really want to know the types of errors you can make.</p>
<p>There are actually only two errors that can be made. The first error is if you say that is false, when in fact it is true. This means you reject when was true. The second error is if you say that is true, when in fact it is false. This means you fail to reject when is false. The following table organizes this for you:</p>
<p>Type of errors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th align="left">true</th>
<th align="left">false</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Reject</td>
<td align="left">Type I error</td>
<td align="left">No error</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Fail to reject</td>
<td align="left">No error</td>
<td align="left">Type II error</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus</p>
<p><strong>Type I Error</strong> is rejecting when is true, and</p>
<p><strong>Type II Error</strong> is failing to reject when is false.</p>
<p>Since these are the errors, then one can define the probabilities
attached to each error.</p>
<p>= P(type I error) = P(rejecting / is true)</p>
<p>= P(type II error) = P(failing to reject / is false)</p>
<p>is also called the <strong>level of significance</strong>.</p>
<p>Another common concept that is used is Power = [MISSING].</p>
<p>Now there is a relationship between and . They are not complements of each other. How are they related?</p>
<p>If increases that means the chances of making a type I error will increase. It is more likely that a type I error will occur. It makes sense that you are less likely to make type II errors, only because you will be rejecting more often. You will be failing to reject less, and therefore, the chance of making a type II error will decrease. Thus, as increases, will decrease, and vice versa. That makes them seem like complements, but they aren’t complements. What gives? Consider one more factor – sample size.</p>
<p>Consider if you have a larger sample that is representative of the population, then it makes sense that you have more accuracy then with a smaller sample. Think of it this way, which would you trust more, a sample mean of 490 if you had a sample size of 35 or sample size of 350 (assuming a representative sample)? Of course the 350 because there are more data points and so more accuracy. If you are more accurate, then there is less chance that you will make any error. By increasing the sample size of a representative sample, you decrease both and .</p>
<p>Summary of all of this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For a certain sample size, <em>n</em>, if increases, decreases.</p></li>
<li><p>For a certain level of significance, , if <em>n</em> increases, decreases.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now how do you find and ? Well is actually chosen. There are only three values that are usually picked for : 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10. is very difficult to find, so usually it isn’t found. If you want to make sure it is small you take as large of a sample as you can afford provided it is a representative sample. This is one use of the Power. You want to be small and the Power of the test is large. The Power word sounds good.</p>
<p>Which pick of do you pick? Well that depends on what you are working on. Remember in this example you are the buyer who is trying to get out of a contract to buy these batteries. If you create a type I error, you said that the batteries are bad when they aren’t, most likely the manufacturer will sue you. You want to avoid this. You might pick to be 0.01. This way you have a small chance of making a type I error. Of course this means you have more of a chance of making a type II error. No big deal right? What if the batteries are used in pacemakers and you tell the person that their pacemaker’s batteries are good for 500 days when they actually last less, that might be bad. If you make a type II error, you say that the batteries do last 500 days when they last less, then you have the possibility of killing someone. You certainly do not want to do this. In this case you might want to pick as 0.10. If both errors are equally bad, then pick as 0.05.</p>
<p>The above discussion is why the choice of depends on what you are researching. As the researcher, you are the one that needs to decide what level to use based on your analysis of the consequences of making each error is.</p>
<p>If a type I error is really bad, then pick = 0.01.</p>
<p>If a type II error is really bad, then pick = 0.10</p>
<p>If neither error is bad, or both are equally bad, then pick = 0.05</p>
<p>The main thing is to always pick the before you collect the data and start the test.</p>
<p>The above discussion was long, but it is really important information. If you don’t know what the errors of the test are about, then there really is no point in making conclusions with the tests. Make sure you understand what the two errors are and what the probabilities are for them.</p>
<p>Now it is time to go back to the example and put this all together. This is the basic structure of testing a hypothesis, usually called a hypothesis test. Since this one has a test statistic involving <em>z</em>, it is also called a <em>z</em>-test. And since there is only one sample, it is usually called a one-sample <em>z</em>-test.</p>

<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Interpretation:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Since you rejected , what does this mean in the real world? That is
what goes in the interpretation. Since you rejected the claim by the
manufacturer that the mean life of the batteries is 500 days, then you
now can believe that your hypothesis was correct. In other words,
there is enough evidence to show that the mean life of the battery is
less than 500 days.</p>
<p>Now that you know that the batteries last less than 500 days, should
you cancel the contract? Statistically, there is evidence that the
batteries do not last as long as the manufacturer says they should.
However, based on this sample there are only ten days less on average
that the batteries last. There may not be practical significance in
this case. Ten days do not seem like a large difference. In reality,
if the batteries are used in pacemakers, then you would probably tell
the patient to have the batteries replaced every year. You have a
large buffer whether the batteries last 490 days or 500 days. It seems
that it might not be worth it to break the contract over ten days.
What if the 10 days was practically significant? Are there any other
things you should consider? You might look at the business
relationship with the manufacturer. You might also look at how much it
would cost to find a new manufacturer. These are also questions to
consider before making any changes. What this discussion should show
you is that just because a hypothesis has statistical significance
does not mean it has practical significance. The hypothesis test is
just one part of a research process. There are other pieces that you
need to consider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s it. That is what a hypothesis test looks like. All hypothesis
tests are done with the same six steps. Those general six steps are
outlined below.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>State the random variable and the parameter in words. This is where
you are defining what the unknowns are in this problem.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>x = random variable</p>
<p>= mean of random variable, if the parameter of interest is the mean.

appropriate symbol for that parameter.</p>

when the different hypothesis tests are discussed.</p></li>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This depends on what parameter you are working with, how many samples,
and the assumptions of the test. The p-value depends on your . If you
are doing the with the less than, then it is a left-tailed test, and
you find the probability of being in that left tail. If you are doing
the with the greater than, then it is a right-tailed test, and you
find the probability of being in the right tail. If you are doing the
with the not equal to, then you are doing a two-tail test, and you
find the probability of being in both tails. Because of symmetry, you
could find the probability in one tail and double this value to find
the probability in both tails.</p>

<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where you write reject or fail to reject . The rule is: if the
p-value &lt; , then reject . If the p-value , then fail to reject</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Interpretation</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where you interpret in real world terms the conclusion to the
test. The conclusion for a hypothesis test is that you either have
enough evidence to show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to
show is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, one more concept about the conclusion and interpretation. First,
the conclusion is that you reject or you fail to reject . Why was it
said like this? It is because you never <strong>accept</strong> the null hypothesis.
If you wanted to accept the null hypothesis, then why do the test in the
first place? In the interpretation, you either have enough evidence to
show is true, or you do not have enough evidence to show is true. You
wouldn’t want to go to all this work and then find out you wanted to
accept the claim. Why go through the trouble? You always want to show
that the alternative hypothesis is true. Sometimes you can do that and
sometimes you can’t. It doesn’t mean you proved the null hypothesis; it
just means you can’t prove the alternative hypothesis. Here is an
example to demonstrate this.</p>
<p><strong>Example #7.1.3: Conclusions in Hypothesis Tests</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the U.S. court system a jury trial could be set up as a hypothesis
test. To really help you see how this works, let’s use OJ Simpson as
an example. In the court system, a person is presumed innocent until
he/she is proven guilty, and this is your null hypothesis. OJ Simpson
was a football player in the 1970s. In 1994 his ex-wife and her friend
were killed. OJ Simpson was accused of the crime, and in 1995 the case
was tried. The prosecutors wanted to prove OJ was guilty of killing
his wife and her friend, and that is the alternative hypothesis</p>
<p>In this case, a verdict of not guilty was given. That does not mean
that he is innocent of this crime. It means there was not enough
evidence to prove he was guilty. Many people believe that OJ was
guilty of this crime, but the jury did not feel that the evidence
presented was enough to show there was guilt. The verdict in a jury
trial is always guilty or not guilty!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same is true in a hypothesis test. There is either enough or not
enough evidence to show that alternative hypothesis. It is not that you
proved the null hypothesis true.</p>
<p>When identifying hypothesis, it is important to state your random
variable and the appropriate parameter you want to make a decision
about. If count something, then the random variable is the number of
whatever you counted. The parameter is the proportion of what you
counted. If the random variable is something you measured, then the
parameter is the mean of what you measured. (Note: there are other
parameters you can calculate, and some analysis of those will be
presented in later chapters.)</p>

<li>The plant-breeding department at a major university developed a new
hybrid raspberry plant called YumYum Berry. Based on research data,
the claim is made that from the time shoots are planted 90 days on
average are required to obtain the first berry with a standard
deviation of 9.2 days. A corporation that is interested in marketing
the product tests 60 shoots by planting them and recording the
number of days before each plant produces its first berry. The
sample mean is 92.3 days. The corporation wants to know if the mean
number of days is more than the 90 days claimed. State the type I
and type II errors in terms of this problem, consequences of each
error, and state which level of significance to use.</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p><em>x</em> = time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant</p>
<p>= mean time to first berry for YumYum Berry plant</p>
<p>Type I Error: If the corporation does a type I error, then they will
say that the plants take longer to produce than 90 days when they
don’t. They probably will not want to market the plants if they think
they will take longer. They will not market them even though in
reality the plants do produce in 90 days. They may have loss of future
earnings, but that is all.</p>
<p>Type II error: The corporation do not say that the plants take longer
then 90 days to produce when they do take longer. Most likely they
will market the plants. The plants will take longer, and so customers
might get upset and then the company would get a bad reputation. This
would be really bad for the company.</p>

would say there is a problem when there isn’t one. You could anger the
Aboriginal community, and spend time and energy researching something
that isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>Type II error: Failing to reject that the proportion of Aboriginal
prisoners who died was 0.27%, when in fact it is higher than 0.27%.
This would mean that you wouldn’t think there was a problem with
Aboriginal prisoners dying when there really is a problem. You risk
causing deaths when there could be a way to avoid them.</p>

may be a way to stop it. It may be best to pick a 5% level of

<p>Hint – hypothesis testing is really easy if you follow the same recipe
every time. The only differences in the various problems are the
assumptions of the test and the test statistic you calculate so you can
find the p-value. Do the same steps, in the same order, with the same
words, every time and these problems become very easy.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> One-Sample Proportion Test</h2>
<p>There are many different parameters that you can test. There is a test for the mean, such as was introduced with the z-test. There is also a test for the population proportion, <em>p</em>. This is where you might be curious if the proportion of students who smoke at your school is lower than the proportion in your area. Or you could question if the proportion of accidents caused by teenage drivers who do not have a drivers’ education class is more than the national proportion.</p>
<p>To test a population proportion, there are a few things that need to be defined first. Usually, Greek letters are used for parameters and Latin letters for statistics. When talking about proportions, it makes sense to use <em>p</em> for proportion. The Greek letter for <em>p</em> is , but that is too confusing to use. Instead, it is best to use <em>p</em> for the population proportion. That means that a different symbol is needed for the sample proportion. The convention is to use, , known as p-hat. This way you know that <em>p</em> is the population proportion, and that is the sample proportion related to it.</p>
<p>Now proportion tests are about looking for the percentage of individuals who have a particular attribute. You are really looking for the number of successes that happen. Thus, a proportion test involves a binomial distribution.</p>

reasons why you can’t say that is true. It could be that the countries
you chose were not very representative of what truly happens. If you
instead looked at all high-income countries and compared them to
low-income countries, you might have different results. It could also be
that the sample you collected in the low-income country was not
representative. It could also be that income level is not an indication
of breastfeeding habits. There could be other factors involved. This is
why you can’t say that you have proven is true. There are too many other

<div id="one-sample-test-for-the-mean" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> One-Sample Test for the Mean</h2>
<p>It is time to go back to look at the test for the mean that was
introduced in section 7.1 called the z-test. In the example, you knew
what the population standard deviation, , was. What if you don’t know ?</p>
<p>You could just use the sample standard deviation, <em>s</em>, as an
approximation of. That means the test statistic is now . Great, now you
can go and find the p-value using the normal curve. Or can you? Is this
new test statistic normally distributed? Actually, it is not. How is it
distributed? A man named W. S. Gossett figured out what this
distribution is and called it the Student’s t-distribution. There are
some assumptions that must be made for this formula to be a Student’s
t-distribution. These are outlined in the following theorem. Note: the
t-distribution is called the Student’s t-distribution because that is
the name he published under because he couldn’t publish under his own
name due to employer not wanting him to publish under his own name. His
employer by the way was Guinness and they didn't want competitors
knowing they had a chemist working for them. It is not called the
Student’s t-distribution because it is only used by students.</p>
<p>Theorem: If the following assumptions are met</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A random sample of size <em>n</em> is taken.</p></li>
<li><p>The distribution of the random variable is normal or the sample size
is 30 or more.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Then the distribution of is a Student’s t-distribution with degrees of
freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Explanation of degrees of freedom:</strong> Recall the formula for sample
standard deviation is . Notice the denominator is . This is the same as
the degrees of freedom. This is no accident. The reason the denominator
and the degrees of freedom are both comes from how the standard
deviation is calculated. Remember, first you take each data value and
subtract . If you add up all of these new values, you will get 0. This
must happen. Since it must happen, the first data values you have
“freedom of choice”, but the nth data value, you have no freedom to
choose. Hence, you have degrees of freedom. Another way to think about
it is that if you five people and five chairs, the first four people
have a choice of where they are sitting, but the last person does not.
They have no freedom of where to sit. Only people have freedom of
choice.</p>
<p>The Student’s t-distribution is a bell-shape that is more spread out
than the normal distribution. There are many t-distributions, one for
each different degree of freedom.</p>
<p>Here is a graph of the normal distribution and the Student’s
t-distribution for df = 1 and df = 2.</p>
<p><strong>Figure #7.3.1: Typical Student t-Distributions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="media/image196.png" style="width:3.76389in;height:2.20833in" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the degrees of freedom increases, the student’s t-distribution looks
more like the normal distribution.</p>
<p>To find probabilities for the t-distribution, again technology can do
this for you. There are many technologies out there that you can use.</p>
<p>On the TI-83/84, the command is in the DISTR menu and is tcdf(. The

</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to check the assumptions of t-test:</strong></p>
<p>In order for the t-test to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be
true. Whenever you run a t-test, you must make sure the assumptions are
true. You need to check them. Here is how you do this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For the condition that the sample is a random sample, describe how
you took the sample. Make sure your sampling technique is random.</p></li>
<li><p>For the condition that population of the random variable is normal,
remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: if the assumptions behind this test are not valid, then the
conclusions you make from the test are not valid. If you do not have a
random sample, that is your fault. Make sure the sample you take is as
random as you can make it following sampling techniques from chapter 1.
If the population of the random variable is not normal, then take a
sample larger than 30. If you cannot afford to do that, or if it is not
logistically possible, then you do different tests called non-parametric
tests. There is an entire course on non-parametric tests, and they will
not be discussed in this book.</p>
