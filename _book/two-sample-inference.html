<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 9</span> Two-Sample Inference</h1>
<p>Chapter 7 discussed methods of hypothesis testing about one-population parameters. Chapter 8 discussed methods of estimating population parameters from one sample using confidence intervals. This chapter will look at methods of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for two populations. Since there are two populations, there are two random variables, two means or proportions, and two samples (though with paired samples you usually consider there to be one sample with pairs collected). Examples of where you would do this are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Testing and estimating the difference in testosterone levels of men
before and after they had children (Gettler, McDade, Feranil &amp; Kuzawa,
2011).</p>
<p>Testing the claim that a diet works by looking at the weight before
and after subjects are on the diet.</p>
<p>Estimating the difference in proportion of those who approve of
President Obama in the age group 18 to 26 year olds and the 55 and
over age group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of these are examples of hypothesis tests or confidence intervals for two populations. The methods to conduct these hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be explored in this method. As a reminder, all hypothesis tests are the same process. The only thing that changes is the formula that you use. Confidence intervals are also the same process, except that the formula is different.</p>
<div id="two-proportions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Two Proportions</h2>
<p>There are times you want to test a claim about two population
proportions or construct a confidence interval estimate of the
difference between two population proportions. As with all other
hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same
though the formulas and assumptions are different.</p>

<p><strong>Confidence Interval for the Difference Between Two Population
Proportion (2-Prop Interval)</strong></p>
<p>The confidence interval for the difference in proportions has the same
random variables and proportions and the same assumptions as the
hypothesis test for two proportions. If you have already completed the
hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you
haven’t completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables
and proportions and state and check the assumptions before completing
the confidence interval step.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

</ol>
<p>The critical value is a value from the normal distribution. Since a
confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error
amount from the sample proportion, and the interval has a probability of
being true, then you can think of this as the statement . So you can use
the invNorm command on the TI-83/84 calculator or qnorm on R to find the
critical value. These are always the same value, so it is easier to just
look at the table A.1 in the Appendix.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Paired Samples for Two Means</h2>
<p>Are two populations the same? Is the average height of men taller than the average height of women? Is the mean weight less after a diet than before?</p>
<p>You can compare populations by comparing their means. You take a sample from each population and compare the statistics.</p>
<p>Anytime you compare two populations you need to know if the samples are independent or dependent. The formulas you use are different for different types of samples.</p>
<p>If how you choose one sample has no effect on the way you choose the other sample, the two samples are <strong>independent.</strong> The way to think about it is that in independent samples, the individuals from one sample are overall different from the individuals from the other sample. This will mean that sample one has no affect on sample two. The sample values from one sample are not related or paired with values from the other sample.</p>
<p>If you choose the samples so that a measurement in one sample is paired with a measurement from the other sample, the samples are <strong>dependent</strong> or <strong>matched</strong> or <strong>paired</strong>. (Often a before and after situation.) You want to make sure the there is a meaning for pairing data values from one sample with a specific data value from the other sample. One way to think about it is that in dependent samples, the individuals from one sample are the same individuals from the other sample, though there can be other reasons to pair values. This makes the sample values from each sample paired.</p>
<p><strong>Example #9.2.1: Independent or Dependent Samples</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Determine if the following are dependent or independent samples.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Randomly choose 5 men and 6 women and compare their heights</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Independent, since there is no reason that one value belongs to another. The individuals are not the same for both samples. The individuals are definitely different. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a man is chosen in one sample does not give any information about any of the woman chosen in the other sample.</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Choose 10 men and weigh them. Give them a new wonder diet drug and later weigh them again.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Dependent, since each person’s before weight can be matched with their after weight. The individuals are the same for both samples. A way to think about this is that the knowledge that a person weighs 400 pounds at the beginning will tell you something about their weight after the diet drug.</p>

<p><strong>How to check the assumptions of t-test and confidence interval:</strong></p>
<p>In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be met. So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are met. So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For the assumption that the sample is a random sample, describe how you took the samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random and that the samples were dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>For the assumption that the population of the differences is normal, remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>There is enough evidence to show that the weight loss program is effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: Just because the hypothesis test says the program is effective doesn’t mean you should go out and use it right away. The program has statistical significance, but that doesn’t mean it has practical significance. You need to see how much weight a person loses, and you need to look at how safe it is, how expensive, does it work in the long term, and other type questions. Remember to look at the practical significance in all situations. In this case, the average weight loss was 21.5 pounds, which is very practically significant. Do remember to look at the safety and expense of the drug also.</p>
<p><strong>Example #9.2.3: Hypothesis Test for Paired Samples Using Technology</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New Zealand Air Force purchased a batch of flight helmets. They then found out that the helmets didn’t fit. In order to make sure that they order the correct size helmets, they measured the head size of recruits. To save money, they wanted to use cardboard calipers, but were not sure if they will be accurate enough. So they took 18 recruits and measured their heads with the cardboard calipers and also with metal calipers. The data in centimeters (cm) is in table #9.2.3 (&quot;NZ helmet size,&quot; 2013). Do the data provide enough evidence to show that there is a difference in measurements between the cardboard and metal calipers? Use a 5% level of significance.</p>

<li><p>Real World Interpretation: The mean difference in head measurements between the cardboard and metal calibers is between 0.54 and 2.68 cm. This means that the cardboard calibers measure on average the head of a recruit to be between 0.54 and 2.68 cm more in diameter than the metal calibers. That makes it seem that the cardboard calibers are not measuring the same as the metal calibers.

</ol>
<p>Examples #9.2.2 and #9.2.4 use the same data set, but one is conducting a hypothesis test and the other is conducting a confidence interval. Notice that the hypothesis test’s conclusion was to reject and say that there was a difference in the means, and the confidence interval does not contain the number 0. If the confidence interval did contain the number 0, then that would mean that the two means could be the same. Since the interval did not contain 0, then you could say that the means are different just as in the hypothesis test. This means that the hypothesis test and the confidence interval can produce the same interpretation. Do be careful though, you can run a hypothesis test with a particular significance level and a confidence interval with a confidence level that is not compatible with your significance level. This will mean that the conclusion from the confidence interval would not be the same as with a hypothesis test. So if you want to estimate the mean difference, then conduct a confidence interval. If you want to show that the means are different, then conduct a hypothesis test.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Independent Samples for Two Means</h2>
<p>This section will look at how to analyze when two samples are collected that are independent. As with all other hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, the process is the same though the formulas and assumptions are different. The only difference with the independent t-test, as opposed to the other tests that have been done, is that there are actually two different formulas to use depending on if a particular assumption is met or not.</p>
<p><strong>Hypothesis Test for Independent t-Test (2-Sample t-Test)</strong></p>

<li><p>The two samples are independent.</p></li>
<li><p>Population 1 is normally distributed. Population 2 is normally distributed. Just as before, the t-test is fairly robust to the assumption if the sample size is large. This means that if this assumption isn’t met, but your sample sizes are quite large (over 30), then the results of the t-test are valid.</p></li>
<li><p>The population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal. The old assumption is that the variances are equal. However, this assumption is no longer an assumption that most statisticians use. This is because it isn’t really realistic to assume that the variances are equal. So we will just assume the assumption of the variances being unknown and not assumed to be equal is true, and it will not be checked.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Confidence Interval for the Difference in Means from Two Independent Samples (2 Samp T-Int)</strong></p>
<p>The confidence interval for the difference in means has the same random variables and means and the same assumptions as the hypothesis test for independent samples. If you have already completed the hypothesis test, then you do not need to state them again. If you haven’t completed the hypothesis test, then state the random variables and means and state and check the assumptions before completing the confidence interval step.</p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Statistical Interpretation: In general this looks like, “there is a C% chance that contains the true mean difference.”</p></li>
<li><p>Real World Interpretation: This is where you state what interval contains the true difference in means, though often you state how much more (or less) the first mean is from the second mean.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The critical value is a value from the Student’s t-distribution. Since a confidence interval is found by adding and subtracting a margin of error amount from the difference in sample means, and the interval has a probability of containing the true difference in means, then you can think of this as the statement . To find the critical value you use table A.2 in the Appendix.</p>
<p><strong>How to check the assumptions of two sample t-test and confidence interval:</strong></p>
<p>In order for the t-test or confidence interval to be valid, the assumptions of the test must be true. So whenever you run a t-test or confidence interval, you must make sure the assumptions are true. So you need to check them. Here is how you do this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For the random sample assumption, describe how you took the two samples. Make sure your sampling technique is random for both samples.</p></li>
<li><p>For the independent assumption, describe how they are independent samples.</p></li>
<li><p>For the assumption about each population being normally distributed, remember the process of assessing normality from chapter 6. Make sure you assess each sample separately.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not need to check the equal variance assumption since it is not being assumed.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>The cholesterol level of patients who had heart attacks was measured two days after the heart attack. The researchers want to see if patients who have heart attacks have higher cholesterol levels over healthy people, so they also measured the cholesterol level of healthy adults who show no signs of heart disease. The data is in table #9.3.1 (&quot;Cholesterol levels after,&quot; 2013). Do the data show that people who have had heart attacks have higher cholesterol levels over patients that have not had heart attacks? Test at the 1% level.</p>

<li><p>A random sample of 28 cholesterol levels of patients who had a heart attack is taken. A random sample of 30 cholesterol levels of healthy individuals is taken. The problem does not state if either sample was randomly selected. So this assumption may not be valid.</p></li>
<li><p>The two samples are independent. This is because either they were dealing with patients who had heart attacks or healthy individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Population of all cholesterol levels of patients who had a heart attack is normally distributed. Population of all cholesterol levels of healthy individuals is normally distributed.</p>

<p>So, the population of all cholesterol levels of patients who had

<p>Healthy individuals:</p>

<p>This does not look bell shaped.</p>

<p><embed src="media/image283.emf" style="width:2.125in;height:2.125in" /></p>
<p>There are no outliers.</p>

<p><embed src="media/image284.emf" style="width:2.31944in;height:2.31944in" /></p>
<p>This doesn’t look linear.</p>
<p>So, the population of all cholesterol levels of healthy individuals
is probably not normally distributed.</p>
<p>This assumption is not valid for the second sample. Since the sample
is fairly large, and the t-test is robust, it may not be an issue.
However, just realize that the conclusions of the test may not be
valid.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Which Analysis Should You Conduct?</h2>
<p>One of the most important concept that you need to understand is deciding which analysis you should conduct for a particular situation. To help you to figure out the analysis to conduct, there are a series of questions you should ask yourself.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does the problem deal with mean or proportion?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the problem states explicitly the words mean or proportion, but other times you have to figure it out based on the information you are given. If you counted number of individuals that responded in the affirmative to a question, then you are dealing with proportion. If you measured something, then you are dealing with mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Does the problem have one or two samples?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>So look to see if one group was measured or if two groups were measured. If you have the data sets, then it is usually easy to figure out if there is one or two samples, then there is either one data set or two data sets. If you don’t have the data, then you need to decide if the problem describes collecting data from one group or from two groups.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you have two samples, then you need to determine if the samples are independent or dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the individuals are different for both samples, then most likely the samples are independent. If you can’t tell, then determine if a data value from the first sample influences the data value in the second sample. In other words, can you pair data values together so you can find the difference, and that difference has meaning. If the answer is yes, then the samples are paired. Otherwise, the samples are independent.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Does the situation involve a hypothesis test or a confidence interval?</p>
<p>If the problem talks about &quot;do the data show&quot;, &quot;is there evidence of&quot;, &quot;test to see&quot;, then you are doing a hypothesis test. If the problem talks about &quot;find the value&quot;, &quot;estimate the&quot; or &quot;find the interval&quot;, then you are doing a confidence interval.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So if you have a situation that has two samples, independent samples, involving the mean, and is a hypothesis test, then you have a two-sample independent t-test. Now you look up the assumptions and the formula or technology process for doing this test. Every hypothesis test involves the same six steps, and you just have to use the correct assumptions and calculations. Every confidence interval has the same five steps, and again you just need to use the correct assumptions and calculations. So this is why it is so important to figure out what analysis you should conduct.</p>
